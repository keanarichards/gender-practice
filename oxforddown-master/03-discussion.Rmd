Welcome to `oxforddown` [@lyngsOxforddown2019], a thesis template for R Markdown that I created when writing [my own PhD thesis](https://ulyngs.github.io/phd-thesis/) at the University of Oxford.
This template allows you to write in R Markdown, while formatting the PDF output with the beautiful and time-tested [OxThesis LaTeX template](https://github.com/mcmanigle/OxThesis).
The sample content is partly adapted from [`thesisdown`](https://github.com/ismayc/thesisdown)
