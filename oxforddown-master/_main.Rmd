# Chapter 1: Introduction 

```{=tex}

\markboth{Introduction}{}
```

Women's labor force participation has increased exponentially over the past several decades [@Goldin2006a; @Statistics2020], rising from 32% to 57% between 1960 and 2018 (where women here are defined as 16 years or older) [@Statistics2020; @Blau2017; @Eagly2019], while men's participation has decreased over the same period (from 82% to 69%). As a result, the gender gap in labor force participation fell to a 12% difference. Additionally, women have been increasingly entering previously male-dominated occupations [@Blau2013; @Reskin2009; @England2010].

Despite progress towards gender equality (e.g., women's suffrage, a reversal of the gender education gap, women's increased participation in the labor market) [@Goldin2014; @Goldin2006a; @Goldin2006; @Blau2010; @Blau2013; @Blau2014; @Bianchi2012; @Sayer2005], gender gaps in the labor market persist [@Blau2017; @Goldin2014; @Hegewisch2014; @Bertrand2001; @Blau2014; @Levanon2016; @Blau2006b; @Blau2006a]. One of the most highly cited and tangible metrics for gender disparities in the labor market is the gender wage gap [@Blau2000; @Blau2017; @Nyhus2012; @McGee2015; @Goldin2014; @Hegewisch2014; @Bertrand2001; @Blau2006b]. Recent unadjusted estimates suggest women earn only 79.3% of what men earn [@Blau2017]. 

In the past, gender gaps in education and full-time labor market experience explained a large proportion of the gender wage gap (i.e., 27% in 1980) [@Blau2017]. As women's education and labor force experience has increased over time [@Goldin2006a], the impact of these variables on the gender wage gap has decreased (e.g., 8% in 2010) [@Blau2017]. Since there has been a slowing convergence of the wage gap in recent years [@Blau2006b], identifying and understanding the factors that perpetuate gender differences in labor market outcomes, such as the persistent gender wage gap, is crucial for achieving gender equality in the long-term. 

One area that has been explored extensively within the economics literature is gender differences in competitiveness, both in terms of the choice to compete [for review, see @Niederle2011; @Niederle2017a], to a lesser extent, response to competitions (e.g., performance during competition) [@Gneezy2003; @Gneezy2004; @Gunther2010; @Samak2013]. These studies typically find that women choose to compete less than men, and that they tend to respond less to competition (that is, their performance does not significantly increase to the extent that men's performance does in competitive contexts). Research suggests these gender differences in competitiveness may have implications for real-world economic outcomes [@Buser2014; @Zhang2012; @Buser2017c; @Buser2017b; @Samek2019; @Berge2015; @Reuben2015; @Reuben2017]. For instance, @Buser2014 show that the typical measure of competitiveness used in the lab explains about 20% of gender differences in the choice in an academic track for students entering high school. On the other hand, @Reuben2015 show that gender differences in competitiveness explain about 10% of gender differences in earnings among MBA graduates. Considering these findings, researchers began exploring interventions to increase competitiveness, including enacting gender quotas [@Niederle2013; @Sutter2016], replacing other-competition (i.e., competing against performance of other individuals) with self-competition (i.e., competing against one's previous performance) [@Bonte2018; @Carpenter2018; @Klinowski2019; @Apicella2017a; @Apicella2020], and relaxing pressure during competitions [@Shurchkov2012], among many others [see @Niederle2017a for a review]. We expected that preparation may serve as a viable intervention for increasing women's competitiveness (i.e., choice to compete), since preparation may increase confidence in one's performance and/or reduce perceptions of risk of competition entry, factors that have been well-established as contributors to the gender gap in competitiveness [@Niederle2011], if not factors that fully explain the gender gap [@Veldhuizen2017; @Gillen2019]. 

Thus, it is possible that giving people the chance to prepare would reduce gender disparities in competition. On the other hand, opportunities to prepare might also result in opportunity costs for women, such that women might end up preparing more than necessary before performing. Since prior interventions have not tested the effects of offering individuals the opportunity to prepare before entering a competition, we address this gap in the literature on gender differences in competitiveness through a series of experiments in Chapter 1 where we offer participants variations of the opportunity to prepare (i.e., knowledge of preparation, limited opportunity to prepare, and unlimited opportunity to prepare). We test whether the gender gap in competitiveness is eliminated in the preparation conditions relative to the control conditions. Our research in Chapter 1 also had the explicit goal of identifying whether there are any gender differences in preparation, since any observed gender differences in the tendency to (over)prepare could create opportunity costs for those who choose to prepare. Given the well-established gender differences in risk attitudes and confidence, we reasoned that they might contribute to differences in the desire to prepare before performance. Results from Chapter 1 showed that there are in fact gender differences in preparation, though we did not find gender differences in competitiveness after controlling for gender differences in risk attitudes and confidence. Given these intriguing and novel results, the experiment in Chapter 2 tests whether the gender difference in preparation would be exacerbated in competitive settings, such that women would be especially likely to prepare before entering a competitive, relative to non-competitive, setting. Chapter 2 also seeks to understand the gender difference in preparation further by exploring whether women are more likely to perceive that they prepare less than others relative to men, especially in competitive settings. Overall, these findings have implications for the literature on gender differences in competitiveness and also contribute more generally to our understanding of how interventions intended to reduce gender differences may have negative downstream consequences (e.g., potential opportunity costs of (over)preparing). In addition, we discover a novel gender difference in preparation, which we encourage future research to explore further.

## Summary of main results across studies  

When considered in general, the results of this research suggest that women prepare more than men before performing, regardless of whether they were being compensated based on individual performance (piece-rate) or relative to another individual (competition). And the novel gender difference in preparation discovered in this study aligns with participants' beliefs about gender differences. Given the effects of stereotypes and beliefs about identity-based behavior on one's own behavior [@Bordalo2019; @Miller2016; @Ellemers2018; @Akerlof2000; @Benjamin2010c], stereotypes may be contributing to gender differences ^[Though it is important to flag here that these results were not tested through an experiment, so we cannot directly attest to causality. See Future Research section for suggestions on testing causal effects of gender stereotypes on behavior.], both in preparation observed in this study and competitiveness observed in the literature. In fact, the effects found with regards to gender stereotypes are more robust (that is, replicated across more studies) than the actual gender difference in preparation. Importantly, opportunities to prepare (in various forms) do *not* affect women's willingness to compete. In the subsequent sections, we highlight the main findings that we replicate across studies, along with some study-specific findings.  

### Effects of preparation conditions in Chapter 1 on gender differences in the choice to compete  

We employed three manipulations of the opportunity to prepare in the studies of Chapter 1. First, the knowledge of preparation condition in Study 1 was a way to see if simply knowing about the opportunity to prepare, without experiencing it directly, would reduce the gender differences in the choice to compete. However, we found no evidence of effects of that manipulation on gender differences in competitiveness. Therefore, in Study 2 we tested whether the act of experiencing preparation firsthand through limited preparation for a predetermined number of rounds would affect the gender gap in competitiveness. We expected that seeing the improvement in one's performance over time may have been the key to increasing women's competitiveness. Since the manipulation of preparation in a limited capacity did not show effects on the gender difference in competitiveness in Study 2, we explored unlimited preparation as our opportunity to prepare manipulation in Study 3. One could argue that participants in the limited preparation condition may have felt like they were not getting any additional preparation above and beyond what other participants were receiving because they could not choose how much they prepared, and thus, they did not feel like the preparation would have helped their performance substantially more than it would have helped other participants. Therefore, the unlimited preparation manipulation may have helped participants who took advantage of the opportunity feel as though they had a chance to improve their performance far more than other participants, making them more willing to compete. Yet, we did not find effects of the unlimited preparation condition on gender differences in competitiveness in Study 3 either. Overall, across all three studies in Chapter 1, we do not find evidence that preparation increases men or women’s willingness to compete, despite finding evidence in Study 3 of Chapter 1 that participants believe practicing helps performance on the main task both based on their behavior and their responses to the manipulation check question. Thus, we do not find evidence that any forms of preparation used in the studies of Chapter 1 would serve as a viable intervention to increase women’s competitiveness. 

### Does gender predict preparation? And tests of robustness of gender effect 

Despite the lack of evidence for the effect of preparation on gender differences in the choice to compete, we discovered a sizable gender difference in preparation across multiple measures of preparation, where women choose to prepare more often than men in three out of the four studies in the dissertation. Interestingly, we do not find evidence across any of the studies that the gender difference in preparation varies based on whether participants are competing, either by choice (Chapter 1 studies) or random assignment (Chapter 2 study) - that is, there is not a significant interaction between gender and the payment scheme participants were following across any of the studies. However, we find that being in a competitive environment by itself (whether by choice or not) reliably predicts the decision to prepare, regardless of participant gender. 

Across studies, preparation was operationalized in several ways (i.e., choice to practice multiplication problems, choice to study times tables, amount of time spent studying times tables). The effect of gender on preparation was most robust with the measure of preparation representing the choice to prepare, which was the most consistent measure of preparation used across all four studies of the dissertation. Importantly, the observed gender differences in the choice to practice are not explained by gender differences in risk, confidence, or task scores. Because risk, confidence, and task scores were measured after participants practiced, risk and confidence could still predict decisions to practice so we encourage future research to explore this possibility. 

Finding the effect of gender on the decision to prepare is especially noteworthy because we are drawing from a participant pool (MTurk) where participants could be earning money for their participation through a nearly limitless supply of other studies, so the opportunity costs of preparing may be greater for MTurkers relative to other participant populations, suggesting that this effect could be even stronger when the opportunity costs are lower.

Importantly, across two out of the four studies, we find no gender difference in task performance when controlling for gender differences in risk attitudes and confidence, so the gender difference in the decision to prepare does not seem to be consistently driven by gender differences in the actual need to practice. In the Chapter 2 study, where we find a gender difference in performance on the multiplication task, we argue that one possible reason we find the gender difference was the use of a shortened task (30 seconds instead of two minutes), given previous research suggesting that gender differences in performance emerge under time pressure [@Shurchkov2012]. 

To our knowledge, these studies are the first to demonstrate a gender difference in preparation among adults who must explicitly opt into preparation. However, previous findings within educational contexts have found that women are more likely than men to value dedication and mastery [@Leslie2015; @Kenney-Benson2006], emphasize the importance of hard work [@Mccrea2008; @Hirt2009; @Mccrea2008a], and spend more time preparing than men for an intellectual evaluation when they were told that practice improved future performance [@Kimble2005]. For instance, in a study examining school-aged children’s approach to learning math, researchers found that girls, compared to boys, reported being more motivated to "master" their schoolwork and engage in more effortful learning strategies [@Kenney-Benson2006]. @Becker2010 suggest that women have higher noncognitive skills (e.g., self-motivation) than men along many dimensions, which they argue is reflected in gender differences in a number of academic behaviors and outcomes, such as grades and number of hours worked on homework per week. In one study looking at whether delaying competition affects gender differences in the willingness to compete while providing opportunity to study, @Charness2021 did not find a significant difference in the choice to prepare (*N* = 202). Although it is worth noting that, though the effect is non-significant, women are directionally more likely to prepare in their study. Since studying gender differences in the choice to prepare was not one of the main foci of their research, contrary to ours, it is entirely possible they did not have sufficient power to detect the effect of gender on the choice to prepare as a result. 

In a similar vein, there has been a burgeoning set of research results in recent years suggesting that there are gender stereotypes about brilliance or raw talent, such that women are perceived as less likely to be brilliant or exhibit less raw talent than men, which in turn affects their decisions, preferences, and representation across fields [@Bian2017; @Bian2017a; @Leslie2015; @Meyer2015; @Bian2018; @Storage2020]. @Napp2022 performed an investigation among 500,000 students across 72 countries to test whether the "gender-brilliance" or "gender-talent" stereotype 1) exists internationally and 2) translates to other gender gaps known to be important for gender differences in economic outcomes (i.e., competitiveness, confidence, and willingness to enter certain careers). Based on participants' responses to their measure of the gender-talent stereotype (i.e., testing systematic gender differences in response to a survey question asking "When I am failing, I am afraid that I might not have enough talent."), they find evidence for both of their hypothesized effects. That is, they find that the gender stereotype is present across countries and the strength of the gender-talent stereotype is related to the size of gender gaps in competitiveness, confidence, and willingness to enter male-dominated careers that are stereotyped to require raw talent for success. They note that the gender-talent stereotype does not lead girls to feel as though they should not put effort towards other, perhaps less competitive, domains, where girls are in fact more likely than boys in the study to agree with the sentiment "if I put in enough effort, I can succeed at school." They argue that their findings overall suggest that the gender-talent stereotype is not all-encompassing, such that the stereotype will not affect women and girls' behaviors and preferences in environments that do not fall into male-typed domains. Thus, the gender-talent stereotype may be one factor contributing to the gender difference in preparation, driven by the belief that women lack as much talent as men, and as such, may need to compensate for their lack of talent in environments that are male-typed. Importantly, they also note that the gender-talent stereotype can in some cases have negative consequences for men, such that they may rely too heavily on talent, and end up exerting less effort, leading to lower performance during bouts of sustained effort such as studying or longer cognitive tests [@Balart2019]. Overall, the literature on the gender-talent stereotype is highly relevant to the current dissertation, and we encourage future research to explore how our findings may relate to said stereotype (see Future Directions section). 

#### Possible reasons for Study 3 deviation 

Notably, we do not replicate the effect of gender on the choice to practice problems in Study 3 of Chapter 1. Although we cannot be completely certain what may be underlying our inability to replicate the effect found in the other studies of the dissertation, we describe a few possible explanations here. First, all other studies in the dissertation measured the decision to complete practice problems *after* participants chose to (or in the case of the study in Chapter 2, were randomly assigned to) compete, while Study 3 measured the decision to practice problems *before* the decision to compete, as necessitated by the main manipulation within the study. Thus, the differences in the results across studies could be explained by the effects of the decision to compete on the choice to practice that are not captured in Study 3. In other words, not knowing they might not have to compete could have reduced motivation to practice. There are also fewer participants that are offered the opportunity to practice in Study 3 (N = 531) relative to Study 1 of Chapter 1 (N = 1044), Study 2 of Chapter 1 (N = 1071), or the study in Chapter 2 (N = 3963), again by nature of the study design (i.e., manipulating unlimited opportunity to prepare) so Study 3 likely had less power to detect the effect than the other studies. Finally, the structure of practicing itself was different in Study 3 relative to the other studies. The other studies in the dissertation did not offer participants the opportunity to study multiplication tables as a separate decision from the choice to practice problems, whereas in Study 3 of Chapter 1, participants were first asked whether they would like to study multiplication tables, *then* afterwards were asked whether they would like to practice problems. Perhaps being asked whether they would like to study before being asked whether they would like to practice problems reduced participants' interest in completing practice problems. Notably, regardless of what might be explaining the deviation for this study, we do not find evidence across any of the studies nor any of the measures of preparation that men are significantly or even directionally more likely to prepare than women. 

#### Possible explanations for the gender difference in preparation

The gender difference in preparation observed in the majority of the studies here may be driven by women's relatively greater desire to reduce uncertainty around their future performance (given their greater average risk aversion) and/or increase their performance (given their lower average confidence). Indeed, mastery is an important driver of confidence [for review, see @Gist1992; @Usher2008]. While it is possible that confidence and risk attitudes may be driving the gender difference in preparation and the choice to compete, it is important to note that preparation in our studies did not increase competitiveness in either men or women. Because participants were able to choose to prepare across studies before they completed the measures of risk attitudes and confidence, we are unable to identify whether preparation causally affected confidence and/or risk attitudes. Future work should examine the bidirectional relationships between confidence and preparation and risk and preparation. Of course, other explanations for the gender differences in preparation may also exist, including relative differences in real or perceived opportunity costs, how rewarding it is to prepare, and/or enjoyment on the task, and we encourage future work to explore these alternative explanations. Notably, given the consistency of perceptions of gender differences in preparation found across studies, our results directly speak to another possible explanation for the observed gender difference in preparation: stereotypes that women prepare more than men in general. In fact, gender stereotypes about preparation may be one of the reasons we did not find evidence for the hypothesized interaction between gender and payment scheme on the choice to prepare across any of the studies. Specifically, gender stereotypes about preparation may be so powerful that women prepare more than men regardless of context. Since we collected data both about the choice to prepare and perceptions of gender differences in preparation across all studies in the dissertation, we could directly test whether gender and beliefs about gender differences in preparation were related to the choice to prepare. We find evidence across multiple studies that gender stereotypes are in fact related to preparation, such that women were especially likely to prepare when they believed women prepare more both in general and for the multiplication task. However, we reiterate the importance of testing these effects causally, especially since we are unable to test the directionality of the relationship between perceptions of gender differences and gender differences in behavior in these studies. That is, practicing may have led participants' to believe that other individuals who have the same gender identity practice more (behavior leading to perception) or the belief that other participants who have the same gender identity practice more may have led participants to practice more (perception leading to behavior). As such, we implore future research to explore these questions through experiments. Finally, we found evidence of a gender difference in performance on the task in two of the four studies. As preparing may have helped performance, it is possible that the gender difference was fully explained by gender differences in the need to prepare on the task. Since our research is not able to directly test whether the choice to prepare was driven by the actual need to prepare based on performance, we encourage future research to explore the possibility that gender differences in performance may have been driving the gender difference in preparation by employing less gender-typed tasks (see Future Directions section). 

### Summary of effects of perceptions of gender differences

On top of the gender differences in preparation observed, we find that participants *believe* that women prepare more, both in general and on the multiplication task (incentivized for accuracy) across all four studies. Thus, participants accurately predicted the observed gender differences in preparation, suggesting that they observe these gender differences in preparation directly in their own lives and/or have learned stereotypes surrounding gender differences in preparation. There is extensive work suggesting that beliefs about identity-based behavior and social norms affect subsequent behavior [@Babcock2012; @Bowles2007; @Toosi2019; @Smith2014; @Benjamin2010c; @Bertrand2015; @Akerlof2000]. One possibility is that women may be preparing more  because these beliefs may indirectly make women feel like they are expected to prepare more, and as a result, women may be overpreparing (relative to their actual skill level) before performing. If future work confirms this hypothesis, it would be important to consider interventions that focus on changing beliefs about gender differences in preparation, perhaps by changing norms, which has been shown to be an effective strategy for affecting subsequent behavior [@Miller2016].

We also find that participants consistently say women tend to compete less than men (incentivized for accuracy) and perform just as well on the task as men (incentivized for accuracy). In combination with the beliefs about gender differences in preparation above, these results would suggest participants do not think women are preparing more because they need to compensate for lower task scores or for a lower probability of earnings during competitions. Again, this suggests that women may prepare more than men, regardless of context, which may either contribute to and/or be the result of a stereotype that has been ingrained among the general population.  

### Contribution to the literature on gender differences in competitiveness, risk attitudes, and confidence 

Our results also speak to previous literature on gender differences in competitiveness, risk attitudes, and confidence. In line with recent research attempting to determine whether competitiveness is a stand-alone trait or is fully explained by other factors (e.g., confidence or risk attitudes) [@Gillen2019; @Veldhuizen2017], we find that the effect of gender of the choice to compete is no longer significant when risk attitudes and confidence are included in the model. Thus, our work would suggest that competitiveness is not a stand-alone trait, and instead gender differences in risk attitudes and confidence are underlying the observed gender difference in competitiveness. In line with this possibility, we find robust gender differences in risk attitudes and confidence across all of the studies in this dissertation, replicating previous effects found within the literature [@Croson2009; @Dohmen2011b; @Eckel2008; @Bertrand2010a; @Bertrand2010; @Lundeberg1994; @Mobius2011; @Barber2001].

We also find that, relative to previous research in laboratory settings, there is a smaller proportion of participants that chose to compete overall. We hypothesize that one factor contributing to this discrepancy is the online nature of the competitions used in this study relative to previous studies, which were largely conducted in person. In fact, @Apicella2017a perform online and laboratory experiments of the same design and finds that more participants (48%; 37.5% women and 57.7% men) choose to compete under the traditional competition design in the laboratory setting relative to the proportion of participants (34.3%; 27.8% women and 40% men) that choose to compete in the online version of the experiment (see Table 1 Percentage Choosing Tournament Rate, by Treatment and Gender). Using the same online task as @Apicella2017a, @Charness2021 find that only 27% of men and 28% of women chose to compete in their study. Thus, our research, in combination with the small set of studies that also test gender differences in competitiveness online, may provide insight into environmental characteristics that may increase (in-person, synchronous competition) or decrease (online, asynchronous competition) an individual's competitiveness. Given the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the nature of work, both in the short-term and long-term, future research should explore this possibility experimentally.   

## Implications for interventions on competitiveness

Our research also has important implications for understanding how to shape interventions in a way that is more gender-inclusive. Much of the research on gender differences in competitiveness has focused on designing interventions that increase women’s willingness to compete. Less work has paid attention to the downstream consequences of said interventions for men and women. Our studies directly speak to the possible consequences of said interventions: in testing an intervention to reduce gender differences in competitiveness, we do not find that competition changed women's preparation behaviors substantially, and in fact, we uncover a gender difference in preparation, suggesting that, when given the opportunity, women may spend more time preparing on average than men, and possibly overprepare. 
It is possible that women are especially susceptible to feelings of underpreparation relative to others when they have unlimited time to prepare, which may lead to a range of possible adverse outcomes, such as unnecessary overpreparation. Indeed, there are opportunity costs to (over)preparing, including both economic and social costs, such as lost time with family and friends and missed advancement opportunities.

Relatedly, if women *expect* that they will prepare more in competitive environments, this may, in turn, impact whether they even enter competitive environments. Thus, while the studies in our dissertation suggest that merely giving women more time to prepare does not make them more willing to compete (Chapter 1), anticipated effort could still influence labor market outcomes by affecting women’s decisions to enter certain fields or compete for promotions, for instance. In our studies, we use relatively unimportant tasks that are unlikely to greatly impact one’s earnings. Yet, our work shows a gender difference in preparation, suggesting that our study likely *underestimates* gender differences in choices to prepare for tasks that are more important for one’s career and economic prospects. In this way, our study is providing a conservative test of the gender differences in effort and preparation in the real world. 

If these results apply to outcomes outside of the lab (which would need to be tested empirically), it would challenge prevailing views that gender differences in labor market outcomes could be reduced or eliminated by simple interventions focused on changing women's competitiveness, and in fact, these interventions may actually negatively impact women. 

Other work corroborates the idea that approaches that attempt to "change the women" can backfire, where women may even be penalized in some cases if they engage in behaviors that said interventions encourage. Penalties are social and economic punishments or impediments (e.g., greater dislike or more sabotage) imposed on women who violate gender norms, despite exhibiting the same behavior as their male counterparts [also known as backlash, see @Rudman2012a for review]. Since negotiations may be conceptualized as a competition motivated by self-interest, which is seen as gender-deviant for women [@Amanatullah2010], women who fail to accept others' compensation offers and try to negotiate for higher compensation are rated as less hirable and have fewer people who want to work with them [@Bowles2007]. Mediation analysis shows that people are less willing to work with women who negotiate because they are perceived as more demanding and less nice [@Bowles2007]. More recently, @Exley2020 show that women who are forced to negotiate (that is, those who are encouraged to "lean in") earn significantly less during negotiations, such that their returns to the negotiations were significantly more negative than men who were also forced to negotiate. Although popular culture advocates for women to "lean in," these lines of evidence suggest there are social and economic ramifications for doing so. In fact, @Babcock2012 provides an economic model suggesting that it may be utility-maximizing for women to avoid negotiation because of the importance of social evaluation in career advancement across many occupations. Unfortunately, these penalties for negotiation disadvantage women economically, especially as initial differences in earnings add up over time: differences in starting salaries as small as $5,000 can lead to a half a million dollar gap in wealth by retirement [@Babcock2009].  

Although there is evidence that competition tends to increase performance [@Connelly2014a; @Murayama2012; @Miller2019a], it is important to consider the potential costs of having an exceedingly competitive workplace, especially considering the evidence that competitions may elicit fatigue or stress [@Ryvkin2011; @Zhong2018; @Buckert2017] and long-term stress has severely negative effects on productivity and health [@Dhabhar2014; @Wallace2009; @Isham2021]. 

This observation leads us to the question: is focusing on competitiveness the best approach for improving academic and/or workplace happiness and productivity? Or instead of focusing on forcing individuals across society to accommodate to competitive environments, we make academic and work environments more inclusive of people from all backgrounds and with diverse preferences? Perhaps instead of focusing on other-competition, research should focus more on cooperative or team-based competitions [@Gagliarducci2022; @Kuhn2015] or on self-competition [@Bonte2018; @Carpenter2018; @Klinowski2019; @Apicella2017a; @Apicella2020], assuming these settings do not cause stress or have other negative consequences in their own right, which would need to be tested experimentally. Importantly, cooperation and self-competition (again, trying to outperform one's previous performance) could also positively impact businesses' bottom line more so than competitions, both directly (e.g., by being more motivating and increasing effort) and indirectly (e.g., by reducing the likelihood of a toxic culture, which may be more common in competitive environments). We encourage future research to explore this possibility in the field. 

Even if eliminating competitions from the workplace is not entirely possible, it is still possible to change the nature of competitions themselves to be more gender-inclusive, employing a "change the system", instead of "change the women" approach. In fact, the findings from this study have implications for interventions that focus on individual-level, rather than system-level, institutional approaches. We show that the preparation intervention focused on encouraging women to compete, rather than changing the nature of competition or eliminating competition altogether, had no effect on women's competitiveness. 

There is strong evidence that these change-the-system measures for increasing gender equality in the workplace are effective. We have already discussed the several lines of work showing that women are willing to compete against their previous performance [@Bonte2018; @Carpenter2018; @Klinowski2019; @Apicella2017a; @Apicella2020], which both allows businesses to maintain the purported benefits of competition on performance, while making the competitions more gender-inclusive. There are also several lines of evidence suggesting that either providing more information about the nature of the competition or about one's performance [@Brandts2015; @Balafoutas2019; @Coffman2021b; @Wozniak2014] or making the competitions based on team performance rather than individual performance [@Healy2011; @Dargnies2012; @Kuhn2015] eliminate the gender gap in competitiveness and as such, may serve as other strategies for changing the nature of competitions to be more gender-inclusive. 

On the other hand, @Niederle2013 and @Balafoutas2012 show that requiring a certain number of women be represented among winners of a competition, that is, introducing a gender quota in competitions, significantly increases the proportion of women that choose to enter competitions, and contrary to potential criticisms of quotas, does not decrease overall performance among the winners of said competitions. An additional benefit of gender quotas is that they can reduce bias by increasing exposure to role models, an intervention that has been shown to encourage more women to enter environments that they would otherwise be hesitant or unlikely to enter [@Porter2020; @Busso2021; @Carpio2021; @Boneva2021; @Ginther2020; @Breda2021]. Thus, quotas likely initiate a positive feedback cycle, where increasing the number of women in a given context through quotas increases the likelihood that other women will enter that environment.

Finally, in research exploring the effects of nudges, @He2021 show that women are more likely to compete when the default is to enter a competition, again suggesting that norms may be an incredibly important driver of behavior [also see @Erkal2018]. 

## Considerations of this research 

There are a few considerations that must be taken into account when interpreting our findings. First, we only included two genders in our study - participants who identified as men and women - so we are not able to attest to whether any of the results found across studies hold in other genders. We propose future research attempts to address this drawback by actively recruiting participants with a diverse set of gender identities. 

Also, we used the same study population across all studies: participants recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk. Although this population has been shown to provide results that closely resemble other participant populations [@Rand2012; @Buhrmester2011; @Paolacci2014;@Chandler2016] and we took different measures to ensure high data quality across the studies (e.g., excluding duplicate IP addresses, including only CloudResearch approved participants that must pass screening tests, using Qualtrics' fraud detection software to exclude potentially suspicious/fraudulent responses), it is still entirely possible that the data from these studies do not generalize to other participant populations. For instance, there may be other unmeasured differences between genders that we are not capturing with our data that contribute to the gender difference in preparation. If that possibility is valid, it would suggest that the gender difference in preparation may not be found in other populations where gender differences in said unmeasured confounds are not are not as prominent. As such, future research should attempt to replicate these results in other populations. 

Another unique characteristic of the study is that we employed a simple multiplication task as the main task participants were paid for. Although we originally chose the multiplication task because we predicted that, unlike other tasks, participants can easily see their improvement on the task as they practice, a drawback is that the task is not representative of tasks that are typically used in organizational contexts. Thus, some of the decisions participants made before and after completing the task may not be reflective of decisions made on tasks that may be more relevant in organizational contexts. For that reason, we encourage subsequent research to explore these effects using other, possibly more relevant, tasks (e.g., exploring gender differences in the choice to prepare for interviews). On an encouraging note, many studies within the literature on gender differences in competitiveness also employed math tasks (albeit addition) and the choice to compete in those tasks did predict earnings and career choices [@Reuben2017;@Buser2014], so if those results are at all reflective of the predictive validity of our results, our findings are likely relevant to other contexts. Similarly, in two of out of the four studies (i.e., Study 1 of Chapter 1 and Study study of Chapter 2), we find a significant gender difference in task scores, where women perform less well on the multiplication task than men - even when controlling for other possible contributing variables (i.e., risk, confidence, competition choice). Since gender differences in performance would likely contribute to gender differences in the choice to prepare on a given task, we encourage future research to employ different tasks to understand how the gender difference in the choice to prepare responds to different tasks, especially where performance is consistently the same on average for men and women. This would help us further understand how women's decisions to prepare are responsive to the actual need to prepare given relative performance. 

Finally, all of the experiments in this dissertation were performed online, largely to be able to recruit a large number of participants to maximize power in the shortest time possible. However, in-person behavior may be different from online behavior, so in-person equivalents of these studies should be run to assess whether these results would replicate when participants make these decisions in the presence of other participants that they may be competing against. 

## Future directions

There are a number of avenues for future research in this area. First, we encourage future research to test the robustness of gender differences in preparation outside of online and laboratory settings. Do these findings translate to real-world settings (e.g., through field experiments)? Exploring the gender difference in preparation cross-culturally (e.g., among hunter-gatherer populations) [@Apicella2014a; @Apicella2012; @Apicella2017; @Apicella2015; @Apicella2009; @Apicella2015a; @Apicella2018; @Apicella2007; @Apicella2014; @Apicella2016; @Apicella2018a; @Apicella2007a] would also shed light on the universality of the finding and help to identify cultural, ecological and social factors that exacerbate it.

A second important extension of the work would be to examine how anticipated preparation or workload influences women’s decisions to enter competitive environments. While we did not find that giving women time to prepare makes them more likely to compete, it is still possible that women know that they will end up preparing more in competitive situations and thus, select out of them. As mentioned earlier, there are opportunity costs to preparing. 

A third extension of the current work would be to examine whether women are overpreparing. Does preparation negatively impact women? Does it help women? To determine whether men or women are preparing more (or less) than needed, future research should test whether gender and time chosen to prepare interact to affect a participants’ probability of winning a competition [see @Niederle2007]. Another follow-up study could manipulate whether there is a monetary cost for preparing to explore whether gender differences in the choice to prepare persist despite a clear cost, and whether this leads to gender differences in earnings within the study. 

Finally, it would be important to explore the gender difference in preparation and general beliefs about gender differences in preparation further. For instance, manipulating beliefs about gender differences in preparation on subsequent preparation would show whether stereotypes/beliefs about gender differences causally affect the gender difference in preparation. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the phenomenon would be important to understand if (and how) interventions should be designed to alleviate any of the potentially negative consequences of choosing to prepare indiscriminately and spending too much time preparing when preparation is either costly or there are only marginal returns to preparation. We hypothesize that the gender difference in preparation could be driven by either gender differences in risk, confidence, or by gender stereotypes about gender differences in preparing, but since that was not a focus of our research, we likely did not have sufficient power either statistically and/or by design to identify the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon and urge other researchers to tackle this question more directly (i.e., experimentally). Also, given the large set of studies showing evidence of a gender-talent stereotype and how it relates to decisions and preferences [@Napp2022; @Bian2017; @Bian2017a; @Leslie2015; @Meyer2015; @Bian2018; @Storage2020], we implore other researchers to explore how gender differences in preparation and stereotypes about the differences in preparation may relate to the gender-talent stereotype. Future research should also explore how much preparation is affected by gender stereotypes about the task - such that women may be especially likely to prepare before a male-typed task (e.g., math task) instead of a female-typed task (e.g., verbal task) or generally in settings where they may be susceptible to stereotype threat affecting performance, especially in light of findings that gender differences in performance and decision-making vary based on whether gender stereotypes are prominent in a given context [@Gneezy2003; @Shurchkov2012; @Apicella2015; @Niederle2011].

## Summary 


Previous research suggests that women tend to be more risk-averse [@Croson2009; @Dohmen2011b; @Eckel2008; @Bertrand2010a] and less confident than men [@Bertrand2010; @Lundeberg1994; @Mobius2011; @Barber2001; @Croson2009], which contributes (at least in part) to gender differences in the decision to enter competitions [@Veldhuizen2017; @Gillen2019; @Niederle2011], and in turn, gender differences in earnings. Since confidence and risk attitudes may be affected by the opportunity to prepare, women may be more likely to compete when they have the opportunity to prepare before entering a competition. Through three experiments in Chapter 1, we experimentally tested whether the opportunity to prepare affects gender differences in competitiveness using three operationalizations of preparation (i.e., knowledge of preparation, limited opportunity to prepare, and unlimited opportunity to prepare). We also were interested in exploring the possibility that, perhaps driven by gender differences in confidence and risk attitudes, women may prepare more than men in general. The hypothesis that women prepare more than men in general also aligns with recent evidence that fields with lower representations of women tend to be fields that value brilliance, rather than hard work [@Bian2017a; @Bian2017; @Leslie2015; @Meyer2015], which in turn, as shown experimentally, deters women from entering said fields. Thus, across all studies in Chapter 1, we also explored whether there are gender differences in tendencies to prepare. Given the evidence across two out of three studies in Chapter 1 that women tend to prepare more than men, the study in Chapter 2 experimentally tests whether the effect of gender on preparation is exacerbated when participants are required to compete. We also measure participants' perceptions of their relative practicing. We hypothesized that there may be gender differences in participants' perceptions of their own preparation behaviors, such that women, relative to men,  would be more inclined to think they prepare less than others, especially in competitive environments. 

By using many of the same questions across studies we are able to test the robustness of our effects through replication, which has been proposed as an alternative with more benefits and fewer costs for researchers when compared to pre-analysis plans alone, with the exception of specific cases (e.g., expensive fieldwork) [@Coffman2015]. In fact, @Coffman2015 show that pre-analysis plans do not always significantly decrease the false positive rate, and instead propose that researchers should place a higher priority on attempting to replicating previous results, which are far less susceptible to false positives even in the face of researcher bias (within at least three to five replications) and for which pre-analysis plans can serve as an exceptional guide to the replication process. @Banerjee2020 proposes a different approach to address some of the drawbacks of pre-analysis plans, where researchers include a publicly available document separate from the main results included in the final paper highlighting results from tests specified in the pre-analysis, which we include in the Appendix (see "Pre-registered hypotheses across studies"). 

Here we show that preparation has no impact on willingness to compete. However, we have discovered a gender difference in preparation, along with robust perceptions of gender differences in preparation. While we built off an extensive literature on gender differences in competitiveness, we have unearthed a new gender difference in preparation. (Over)preparing may be costly if individuals do not adjust their level of preparation based on different environments. As this is a new area of research, there are many promising and exciting avenues for future exploration, all of which have the potential to inform policy. First, future work should explore whether these results generalize to other populations and tasks. Second, future work should examine the impact of preparation on payoffs. Do women overprepare relative to their potential payoffs? Do men underprepare? What are the opportunity costs of preparing? Also, it would be important to think about ways that women could be equally rewarded *without* having to compete - that is, reimagining how to support women, and students/workers generally, being productive in ways that work for them. Future work should explore the implications of these findings further in organizational contexts, where these effects may have a long-lasting impact on gender differences in economic outcomes.
