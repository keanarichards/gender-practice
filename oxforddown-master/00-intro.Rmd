More specific detail about evidence that women's labor market outcomes are improving: Women's labor force participation has increased exponentially over the past several decades [@Goldin2006a; @Statistics2020], rising from 32% to 57% between 1960 and 2018 (where women here are defined as 16 years or older) [@Statistics2020; @Blau2017; @Eagly2019], while men's participation has decreased over the same period (from 82% to 69%). As a result, the gender gap in labor force participation fell to a 12% difference. Additionally, women have been increasingly entering male-dominated occupations [@Blau2013; @Reskin2009; @England2010].


Despite incredible progress towards gender equality (e.g., women's suffrage, a reversal of the gender education gap, women's increased participation in the labor market) [@Goldin2014; @Goldin2006a; @Goldin2006; @Blau2010; @Blau2013; @Blau2014; @Bianchi2012; @Sayer2005], gender gaps in the labor market persist [@Blau2017; @Goldin2014; @Hegewisch2014; @Bertrand2001; @Blau2014; @Levanon2016; @Blau2006b; @Blau2006a]. One of the most highly cited and tangible metrics for gender disparities in the labor market is the gender wage gap [@Blau2000; @Blau2017; @Nyhus2012; @McGee2015; @Goldin2014; @Hegewisch2014; @Bertrand2001; @Blau2006b]. Recent unadjusted estimates suggest women earn only 79.3% of what men earn [@Blau2017]. 

In the past, classic human capital variables (e.g., gender gaps in education and work experience) explained a large proportion of the gender wage gap (e.g., 27% in 1980). As women's education and labor force experience has increased over time [@Goldin2006a], the impact of these variables on the gender wage gap has decreased (e.g., 8% in 2010) [@Blau2017]. Instead, the largest factors contributing to the gender wage gap today are workforce interruptions and fewer hours among women, along with persistent gender segregation by field and occupation [@Blau2017; @Goldin2014]. Even after accounting for these factors, there is still an unexplained gap (female-to-male wage ratio at 91.6%). @Blau2017 suggest the unexplained part of the wage gap captures gender discrimination since it reflects the gender disparity between men and women who are identical on all observable measures available. 

Since women's labor market progress has stalled over the past two decades [@Blau2006b; @Goldin2014], identifying and understanding the factors that perpetuate gender differences in labor market outcomes is crucial for achieving gender equality in the long-term. 

Brief summary (1-3 para): prior lit most relevant to diss & gap i’m filling through this research 


1 para on what this dissertation is composed of & what it seeks to do = in chapter 1 will address X, in chap 2 will address Y 

Chapter 1 = other interventions have been done, BUT they haven’t done this 

There are some potential negative effects of these interventions. Transition to next chapter  


Overall, the insights from this
