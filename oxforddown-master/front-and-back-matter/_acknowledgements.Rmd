This project would not have been possible without the support of many people. First, I am incredibly grateful for the support of my mom, Dawn Eden, who has been guiding me in my academic and personal pursuits my whole life. She has sacrificed her own sleep, money, and time on endless occasions to help me get to this point, with an optimism that still inspires and motivates me. I have learned and continue to learn so much from her. I would also like to thank many of my other family members whose support made this dissertation possible. I am especially grateful to my brother, Jared Richards, for being my partner in crime on occasions that would have otherwise been boring and for teaching me so much about spaces that I know very little about. 

Many thanks to my advisers, Coren Apicella and Emily Falk, for their invaluable advice, continuous support, and patience during my PhD journey. I am also grateful for my committee members, Geoffrey Goodwin and Gideon Nave, who offered substantial guidance and support over the last few years of the PhD.

Finally, I would not have been able to finish the thesis if it were not for the numerous friends that have been sources of support, conversation, and laughter during my writing journey. Having enjoyable conversations and experiences to look forward to after writing at the end of the day motivated me to continue working on this project, especially on days where thinking about the thesis was the last thing I wanted to do.
