We find further evidence of a gender difference in the choice to prepare using a different metric of the choice to prepare: the number of times a participant chooses to persist in their practice effort by repeatedly practicing. Here, we find evidence of a significant interaction between gender and the choice to compete on the choice to practice, where women who chose to compete are significantly more likely to practice. However, the small size of this cell must be considered when interpreting this interaction. Future research is needed to ensure this effect replicates. Error bars represent standard errors."}
