# Overview

Compensation packages based on performance pay, such as bonuses, commissions, and piece-rate payments, have risen in popularity relative to hourly/salaried pay, especially among workers in the highest tiers of occupations [@Hall1998; @Murphy1999; @Cunat2005; @Lemiuex2009]. There is evidence that the increasing use of performance pay lends itself to wage inequality. @Lemiuex2009 showed that an increased dependence on performance pay during the late 1970’s and early 1990’s accounted for 21% of the observed growth in variance of male wages. Bonuses and commissions, arguably the most competitive compensation schemes, may be especially important in driving the large disparity between the highest and lowest percentile earners within organizations [@Bell2010; @Bell2014; @Benabou2016]. Importantly, performance pay may contribute to the gender wage gap too. Using data from the National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth, @McGee2015 show that women are less likely to be employed in occupations that receive bonuses, and simultaneously are more likely to receive piece-rate pay – the least competitive of all forms of performance pay, where workers are paid based on their absolute output.

Since competition is relevant to labor market outcomes, researchers began to focus on how a person’s gender affects their response to competition as a means of understanding persistent gender gaps in labor market outcomes [for review, see @Niederle2011]. Seminal work on gender differences in competitiveness operationalized competitiveness as the choice of a tournament payment scheme that reaps potentially higher earnings but requires outperforming an opponent over a piece-rate scheme [@Niederle2007]. This work found that women are less competitive than men, on average, even if they would have earned more by competing [@Niederle2007]. Additionally, this laboratory measure of competitiveness predicts labor market outcomes, such as education choices [@Buser2014; @Zhang2012], entrepreneurial decisions [e.g., investment, employment; @Berge2015], and earnings [@Reuben2015]. Thus, competitive preferences may contribute to gender differences in labor market outcomes [@Blau2017]. 

Follow-up research with nearly identical procedures has replicated the effect of gender on the choice to opt into tournaments [see @Niederle2011 for review]. Notably, this effect has been replicated in diverse populations (e.g., across age groups and cultures) [@Apicella2015; @Buser2014; @Sutter2016; @Andersen2013; @Buser2017b; @Sutter2010; @Dreber2014; @Mayr2012] and with a diverse set of tasks [@Apicella2015; @Saccardo2018; @Bjorvatn2016; @Sutter2015; @Frick2011; @Samek2019]. However, there is evidence that the task used during competition affects the size of the gender gap. For instance, some research suggests that when the task is female-typed or gender-neutral, the gender gap in willingness to compete may be reduced or eliminated [@Iriberri2017; @Boschini2014; @Boschini2019; @Apicella2015; @Grosse2010; @Gunther2010; @Dreber2014; @Dreber2011; @Shurchkov2012]. Drawing from the psychology literature on stereotype threat [@Steele1997; @Spencer1999; @Spencer2016], negative stereotypes about women’s ability to perform male-typed tasks (e.g., math, mental rotation) may produce anxiety and undermine performance. As a result, women may decide not to engage in a competition because they either believe the stereotype or because the stereotype provokes enough anxiety to reduce performance [@Gunther2010; @Grosse2010; @Iriberri2017; @Shurchkov2012]. 

While competitions are generally motivating and designed to improve performance through increased effort [@Connelly2014a; @Murayama2012; @Miller2019a], some research suggests that men perform better under competitive payment schemes relative to non-competitive payment schemes, while women's performance does not respond to competitions [@Gneezy2003; @Gneezy2004; @Gunther2010; @Samak2013]. @Gneezy2003 show that there is no gender difference in performance when participants are solving mazes following a piece-rate payment scheme, but a significant gender difference in performance arises under a tournament payment scheme, with males performing better. @Gunther2010 replicate the effect of competition on gender differences in performance for a male-typed task, but find no gender differences in performance during competition for female-typed or gender-neutral tasks. Relatedly, during repeated competition, women tend to perform worse in subsequent performance rounds after losing, even if the monetary prize they lost was relatively meager, while men only perform worse in subsequent rounds if they lost the chance to win a large monetary prize [@Gill2014]. Other research suggests women stop competing altogether after losing if given the choice. @Buser2019, who examine the effects of losing while competing in the Dutch Math Olympiad on the choice to compete in subsequent years, show that men are just as likely to compete even if they lost the previous year, while women are less likely to compete again if they lost before. This body of literature suggests that competitions may differentially impact women and men. 

To date, most of the research on gender differences in competitions has focused on either i) explaining the sources of the gender difference [e.g., @Veldhuizen2017] or ii) designing interventions to encourage women to compete more [@Balafoutas2012; @Sutter2016; @Cassar2016; @Brandts2015; @Niederle2013; @Brandts2015; @Healy2011; @Alan2018]. Less consideration has been paid to how competitions differentially, and negatively, impact women. However, as the research on gender differences in performance during competition suggests [@Gneezy2003; @Gneezy2004; @Gunther2010; @Gill2014; @Buser2019; @Samak2013; @Miller2019a], it is also important to consider potential downstream consequences of women's entry into competitions. 

The present proposal builds on prior research by examining how competitions affect gender differences in the amount of time spent preparing for competitions. We hypothesize that women will spend more time preparing than men, especially before competitions, in part because they are, on average, less risk-seeking [@Croson2009; @Dohmen2011b; @Eckel2008; @Bertrand2010a] and confident [@Bertrand2010; @Lundeberg1994; @Mobius2011; @Barber2001; @Croson2009] than men. Indeed, both confidence and risk attitude have been implicated in driving the gender gap in willingness to compete [@Niederle2011; @Veldhuizen2017].  

The extent to which confidence and risk attitude account for the gender gap in willingness to compete is debated. The seminal research in this literature suggests that confidence and risk attitude do not completely explain the gender gap in the choice to compete, since there remains a residual gap in the choice to compete after controlling for these factors [@Niederle2007]. The unexplained component of the original gender effect was taken as evidence of a distinct "competitiveness" trait, separate from risk attitude and confidence [@Niederle2007; @Niederle2011]. However, recent work correcting for measurement error [@Gillen2019] and using experimental techniques to isolate the effects of the competitiveness trait [@Veldhuizen2017] suggests that risk attitude and confidence may fully explain the gender gap in the choice to compete. Regardless of whether competitiveness is a stand-alone trait, it is clear that confidence and risk attitude can generate differences in how men and women react to competitions, possibly including the decision to prepare before a competition. 

Confidence is conceptualized as the accuracy of one’s perceived performance or ability on a task [@Beyer1997]. Since competitions, by definition, compare the performance among two or more individuals, they naturally lead to self-evaluation and comparative judgments of self with others - processes that are intimately linked to confidence. To the extent that confidence influences how much individuals think they need to prepare in order to win, we may expect to see women preparing more than men, particularly in competitive contexts, which naturally invoke self-other assessments. Thus, less confident individuals may prepare more. Moreover, they may prepare more in order to reduce the negative feelings caused by low confidence independent of any ambitions to win. Indeed, mastery is an important driver of confidence [for review, see @Gist1992; @Usher2008] and there is no theoretical or empirical reason to suspect that women would be less concerned with mastery than men. In fact, research suggests that women are just as likely as men to compete when competing against their own past performance, suggesting an equal desire for self-improvement [@Apicella2017a]. 

There is ample research to suggest that women are less (over)confident on average than men across a number of domains [@Mobius2011; @Niederle2011; @Croson2009; @Lundeberg1994; @Niederle2007; @Bertrand2010a; @Beyer1990; @Beyer1997]. Within the literature on the gender gap in competitiveness, confidence is operationalized as the belief about one’s relative performance during a competition, where individuals who have inaccurately high ratings of their performance are deemed overconfident. If an individual does not feel as though their performance is higher than individuals they are competing against, they are unlikely to make the decision to compete for fear of missing the opportunity to earn money, even if they would otherwise outperform their opponent. Although both men and women tend to be overconfident, men are far more likely to fall into the trap of overconfidence, which leads them to compete more often than they should, given their actual ability [@Niederle2007]. 

Another variable that has been identified as a possible explanation for gender differences in competitiveness is risk attitude, typically construed as the preference for a certain gain over a gamble, even if the gamble has an equal or greater monetary expectation [@Kahneman1982]. For instance, a risk averse person would prefer a sure gain of $80 over a gamble where they have an 85 percent chance of winning \$100 and a 15 percent chance of winning \$0, even though the monetary expectation in the latter case is higher (e.g., average of \$85 in earnings relative to an average of \$80) [@Kahneman1982]. Payment based on the outcomes of a competition are inherently riskier than non-competitive payment schemes (e.g., guaranteed payment per unit of output) because in most cases, there is uncertainty surrounding one's relative performance [@Niederle2011]. Several studies across diverse settings have documented a gender difference in risk attitudes, where women tend to be more risk-averse than men on average [@Bertrand2010a; @Croson2009; @Apicella2017]. Because competitions are riskier and women tend to be more risk-averse, women may prepare more than men before competing to reduce some of the uncertainty of performing during competition. 

The current proposal examines gender differences in preparation in competitive contexts. Because women tend to be more risk-averse [@Croson2009; @Dohmen2011b; @Eckel2008; @Bertrand2010a], less confident [@Bertrand2010; @Lundeberg1994; @Mobius2011; @Barber2001; @Croson2009] and prefer to opt out of competitions [@Niederle2011], they may engage in more coping strategies, such as preparation, before entering competitions. While there is no literature examining how competitions might impact gender differences in preparation, there is a small literature suggesting that women are more likely than men to value dedication and mastery [@Leslie2015; @Kenney-Benson2006], emphasize the importance of hard work [@Mccrea2008; @Hirt2009; @Mccrea2008a], and spend more time preparing than men in general [@Kimble2005; @Lucas2005]. For instance, in a study examining school-aged children’s approach to learning math, researchers found that girls, compared to boys, reported being more motivated to “master” their schoolwork and engage in more effortful learning strategies [@Kenney-Benson2006].

Additionally, in my own research, I discovered a sizable gender difference in effort, where women were more likely than men to choose to prepare before completing a multiplication task (Richards et al., in prep) ^[All prior studies were pre-registered on Open Science Framework]. The goal of this work was to explore how preparation might influence women’s willingness to compete. The first preliminary study in this line of work manipulated participants’ (_N_ = `r nrow(clean)`) knowledge of whether they would have unlimited time to prepare before they made their decision to compete. We expected that participants who knew they had time to prepare would be more inclined to compete compared to participants who were not aware of the opportunity to prepare. While we did not find that knowledge of preparation affected participants’ decision to compete, there was a sizable gender difference in the choice to prepare. Controlling for the decision to compete, women were `r round((exp(coef(primary_hyp2))[2] - 1)*100, digits = 0)`% more likely to choose to prepare compared to men when offered the opportunity, `r apa_print(primary_hyp2)$full_result$genderWoman` (see Figure 1). Additionally, at the end of the experiment, participants were incentivized to correctly predict which gender they believed would be more likely to prepare in the study. Both men (`r round(ctable(clean$gender, clean$perc_task_gender_pract)$proportions[4]*100, digits = 0)`%) and women (`r round(ctable(clean$gender, clean$perc_task_gender_pract)$proportions[5]*100, digits = 0)`%) correctly believed that women would spend more time preparing for the task, `r apa_print(exploratory7c, n= nrow(clean))$statistic`. We found similar results when asking participants which gender prepares more in general - `r round(ctable(clean$gender, clean$perc_gen_gender_pract)$proportions[4]*100, digits = 0)`% of men and `r round(ctable(clean$gender, clean$perc_gen_gender_pract)$proportions[5]*100, digits= 0)`% of women believed that women prepare more in general, `r apa_print(exploratory7c, n= nrow(clean))$statistic`. 


In a follow-up study designed to examine the role of forced preparation on the decision to compete, we recruited `r nrow(clean)` participants from Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), who were assigned to either a condition where they were required to complete several rounds of practice for the upcoming paid multiplication task or several rounds of a filler task before choosing their payment scheme. Again, our manipulation had no effect on the choice to compete in men or women. However, after completing their respective rounds of practice and choosing their payment scheme, participants in both conditions had the option to spend (extra) time preparing for the multiplication task. Here, we replicated the effect of gender on preparation, where `r round(ctable(clean$gender, clean$pract_choice)$proportions[5]*100, digits =0)`% of women and `r round(ctable(clean$gender, clean$pract_choice)$proportions[4]*100, digits = 0)`% of men chose to complete the optional preparation while controlling for the choice to compete, `r apa_print(sec_exploratory2)$full_result$genderWoman` (see Figure 2). In fact, even in the condition where participants were forced to prepare for 12 rounds, lasting on average two minutes, there was a significant effect of gender on the choice to prepare, `r apa_print(sec_exploratory3)$full_result$genderWoman`. Here too, we find that participants correctly predicted that women prepared more for the task, `r apa_print(exploratory3d, n= nrow(clean))$statistic`. They also reported that women are more likely to prepare in general, `r apa_print(exploratory3c, n= nrow(clean))$statistic`. Overall, our previous work provides compelling evidence that women are more likely to prepare than men, even after being forced to do so. 


While this research did not find that preparation affects decisions to compete, we did uncover a sizable gender difference in decisions to prepare. In light of this discovery, we have flipped our research question and now ask whether and how competitions affect men and women’s decisions to prepare. To be clear, there was no interaction between gender and choice to compete on the choice to prepare in either of the previous studies. That is, women prepared more than men regardless of which payment scheme they had chosen. However, it is not possible to draw conclusions from this because i) we did not manipulate the payment scheme, so there could have been selection effects on one’s choice to prepare across payment schemes, such that those who were more likely to choose to compete may have been less likely to prepare, and ii) there was little power to detect any possible interaction effects. For instance, in the first study, only 11% of women chose to compete, and in the second, `r round(ctable(clean$gender, clean$comp_choice)$proportions[5]*100, digits = 0)`% of women made this decision. Through the proposed experiments, we intend to address these limitations by directly manipulating participants' payment scheme and recruiting a large sample to provide power to detect small effects. 

Here, we propose two studies. In Study 1, we will test whether competition exacerbates previously established gender differences in preparation by manipulating participants’ assigned payment scheme (i.e., competitive or non-competitive). We will also explore whether the effect of confidence and risk attitude on preparation differ based on participant gender and condition. Based on research suggesting that task type affects women’s decision to compete [@Iriberri2017; @Boschini2014; @Boschini2019; @Apicella2015; @Grosse2010; @Gunther2010; @Dreber2014; @Dreber2011; @Shurchkov2012], Study 2 will explore whether beliefs about how each gender will perform on a matching task affects gender differences in preparation before competitions. Here, we expect women will spend significantly more time preparing for the matching task when participants believe, based on how previous research is described, men will outperform women, but the gender difference in preparation will be reduced when participants believe women will outperform men.
