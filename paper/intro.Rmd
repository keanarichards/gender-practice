Women have surpassed men in education outcomes, like college attendance and graduation rates [@Blau2017; @Goldin2006; @Stoet2014], but are still underrepresented in top management positions in nearly all sectors [@Bertrand2001] and earn less than men, on average [@Blau2017]. Traditional economic variables account for some, but not all, of these disparities [@Blau2017]. As a means of understanding persistent gender gaps in labor market outcomes, researchers have begun to focus on how gender affects one’s response to competition [for review, see @Niederle2011]. Seminal work on gender differences in competitiveness operationalized competitiveness as the choice of a tournament payment scheme that reaps potentially higher earnings but requires outperforming an opponent over a piece-rate scheme [@Niederle2007]. This work found that women are less competitive than men, on average, even if they would have earned more by competing [@Niederle2007]. 

Follow-up research with nearly identical procedures has replicated the effect of gender on the choice to opt into tournaments [see @Niederle2011 for review]. Notably, this effect has been replicated in diverse populations (e.g., across age groups and cultures) [@Apicella2015; @Buser2014; @Sutter2016; @Andersen2013; @Buser2017b; @Sutter2010; @Dreber2014; @Mayr2012] and with a diverse set of tasks [@Apicella2015; @Saccardo2018; @Bjorvatn2016; @Sutter2015; @Frick2011; @Samek2019]. Additionally, this laboratory measure of competitiveness predicts labor market outcomes, such as education choices [@Buser2014; @Zhang2012], entrepreneurial decisions [e.g., investment, employment; @Berge2015], and earnings [@Reuben2015]. Thus, competitive preferences may contribute to gender differences in labor market outcomes [@Blau2017]. As such, it is important for organizations to take gender differences in competitiveness into consideration when striving to facilitate gender equality in workplace outcomes and communicating what is required for success.  

Confidence and risk attitudes have been implicated in driving the gender gap in willingness to compete [@Niederle2011; @Veldhuizen2017]. However, the extent to which confidence and risk attitudes account for the gender gap in willingness to compete is debated. The seminal research in this literature suggests that confidence and risk attitudes do not completely explain the gender gap in the choice to compete, since there remained a residual gap in the choice to compete after controlling for these factors [@Niederle2007]. The unexplained component of the original gender effect was then taken as evidence of a distinct "competitiveness" trait, separate from risk attitudes and confidence [@Niederle2007; @Niederle2011]. However, recent work correcting for measurement error [@Gillen2019] and using experimental techniques to isolate the effects of the competitiveness trait [@Veldhuizen2017] suggests that risk attitudes and confidence may fully explain the gender gap in the choice to compete. Regardless of whether competitiveness is a stand-alone trait, it is clear that confidence and risk attitudes can generate differences in how men and women react to competitions. Thus, interventions designed to increase risk-taking or confidence in women may help reduce the gender difference in competitiveness.  

Confidence is conceptualized as the accuracy of one’s perceived performance or ability on a task [@Beyer1997]. Within the literature on the gender gap in competitiveness, confidence is operationalized as the belief about one’s relative performance during a competition, where individuals who have inaccurately high ratings of their performance are deemed overconfident. If an individual does not feel as though their performance is higher than individuals they are competing against, they are unlikely to make the decision to compete for fear of missing the opportunity to earn money, even if they would otherwise outperform their opponent. There is ample research to suggest that women are less (over)confident on average than men across a number of domains [@Mobius2011; @Niederle2011; @Croson2009; @Lundeberg1994; @Niederle2007; @Bertrand2010a; @Beyer1990; @Beyer1997]. Though both men and women tend to be overconfident, women are far less likely to fall into the trap of overconfidence, which leads them to compete less often than they should, given their actual ability [@Niederle2007]. 

Confidence too may help explain why, in some situations, the gender gap in competitiveness may be reduced or eliminated. For instance, women compete more when tasks are female-typed (i.e., women are expected to perform better based on gender stereotypes) or gender-neutral [@Iriberri2017; @Boschini2014; @Boschini2019; @Apicella2015; @Grosse2010; @Gunther2010; @Dreber2014; @Dreber2011; @Shurchkov2012] or when they are facing other female opponents [@DattaGupta2013]. Drawing from the psychology literature on stereotype threat [@Steele1997; @Spencer1999; @Spencer2016], negative stereotypes about women’s ability to perform male-typed tasks (e.g., math, mental rotation) may produce anxiety and undermine performance. As a result, women may decide not to engage in a competition because they either believe the stereotype or because the stereotype provokes enough anxiety to reduce performance [@Gunther2010; @Grosse2010; @Iriberri2017; @Shurchkov2012]. This body of research suggests that organizational communication interventions designed to increase confidence in women may embolden them to compete more. 

Confidence on a task can improve with preparation and training [@Gist1992; @Schunk1981; @Schunk1982; @Usher2008], since, in most cases, people are able to observe a gradual improvement in their skills over time. For instance, @Lent1996 found that college students listed past accomplishments as the most influential factor in determining their confidence. Other research directly compared the effects of mastery experiences, vicarious experiences (e.g., watching others perform a task), and a control treatment without any intervention on confidence, finding that mastery increased confidence significantly more than vicarious experiences and the control treatment [@Bandura1977a]. Based on previous evidence of the benefits of enactive mastery through preparation and training on confidence, providing women with an adequate opportunity to prepare before a task may alleviate the gender gap in choice to compete. Surprisingly, little work has explored how preparation differentially impacts men and women’s confidence or their willingness to compete.

A second variable that has been identified as a possible explanation for gender differences in competitiveness is risk attitudes, typically construed as the preference for a certain gain over a gamble, even if the gamble has an equal or greater monetary expectation [@Kahneman1982]. Several studies across diverse settings have documented a gender difference in risk attitudes, where women tend to be more risk-averse than men on average [@Bertrand2010a; @Croson2009; @Apicella2017]. Payment based on the outcomes of a competition are inherently riskier than non-competitive payment schemes (e.g., guaranteed payment per unit of output) because in most cases, there is uncertainty surrounding one's relative performance [@Niederle2011].  

While recent work suggests that 28% of the gender gap in competitive choices can be explained by risk attitudes [@Gillen2019; @Veldhuizen2017], other work suggests that risk attitudes play little role in women’s decisions to “self-compete”. That is, risk attitudes do not affect whether women choose to compete against their own past performance, possibly because there is less uncertainty in the decision [@Apicella2017a]. Thus, to the extent that preparation too can reduce uncertainty in performance, women may be more likely to compete when there are opportunities for preparation. 

Notably, both knowing about an opportunity to prepare before competing and the actual act of preparing may encourage high-ability women to enter competitions more often. In knowing one can prepare beforehand, one may assume that they can resolve any discrepancies between their current ability and their desired ability level for competition or that they can reduce uncertainty surrounding their performance by preparing. This knowledge, in and of itself, may be sufficient to reduce gender differences in competitiveness, regardless of whether women actually take advantage of this opportunity. Additionally, the act of preparation may be uniquely motivating, since preparation allows an individual to observe an improvement in their performance over time and/or give them an opportunity to observe their performance, which may reduce the perceived uncertainty of competition. As such, women may choose to compete more after preparing for or practicing a task. 

Here, we examined the role of preparation on the gender differences in willingness to compete through two experiments. In the first experiment, we tested whether simply knowing that there will be an opportunity to prepare before performing a task affects the gender gap in willingness to compete. That is, we manipulated participants’ knowledge of whether they had unlimited time to prepare before they made their decision to compete. We anticipated that participants with this information would be more inclined to compete compared to participants without this information and that this effect would be stronger for women, who tend to be relatively less confident. Thus, we expected an interaction between gender and condition on the choice to compete, along with a main effect of condition. In the second experiment, we examined how actual preparation influences the decision to compete. That is, we manipulated whether participants were required to prepare before making the decision to compete. Again, we expected that women in the preparation condition would be especially inclined to compete. In both experiments, we measured gender differences in actual preparation after administering the treatment and eliciting preferences to compete. Finally, we monetarily incentivized participants in both studies to correctly predict which gender would prepare and compete more. The research design, hypotheses, measures and analyses were preregistered unless otherwise stated and all analyses were conducted in R statistical software (version `r paste0(R.Version()$major,".", R.Version()$minor)`).
