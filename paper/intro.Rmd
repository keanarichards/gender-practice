Women have surpassed men in education outcomes, like college attendance and graduation rates [@Blau2017; @Goldin2006; @Stoet2014], but are still underrepresented in top positions in nearly all sectors [@Bertrand2001] and a gender wage gap still persists [@Blau2017]. Traditional economic variables account for some, but not all, of these disparities. As such, additional explanations have been proposed, including gender differences in willingness to compete. Previous research suggests that women are less willing to compete than men, even when they are equally, if not more, qualified [@Niederle2007; for reviews, see @Niederle2011 and @Croson2009]. This effect has been established across numerous studies and appears to be driven by high ability women being less willing to compete compared to their male counterparts, creating higher total costs of pay-off inferior decisions (i.e., under-entry) for women compared to men [@Niederle2007]. 

Understanding how to address gender differences in competitiveness is important for reducing gender inequality that persists today. When women compete less than their male counterparts, they may be missing crucial economic opportunities, as demonstrated by the evidence suggesting competitiveness is relevant to one’s economic outcomes [@Buser2014; @Zhang2012; @Reuben2015]. 

Women’s relatively lower levels of confidence in their performance partly explains this gender difference [@Niederle2011], so it is important to understand factors that may affect confidence prior to the decision to compete. Since prior research has shown that confidence can improve with preparation and training [@Gist1992; @Schunk1981; @Schunk1982], providing women with an adequate opportunity to prepare before a task may alleviate the gender gap in willingness to compete.
