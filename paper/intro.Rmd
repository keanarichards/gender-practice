Women have surpassed men in education outcomes, like college attendance and graduation rates [@Blau2017; @Goldin2006; @Stoet2014], but are still underrepresented in top management positions in nearly all sectors [@Bertrand2001] and a gender wage gap still persists [@Blau2017]. Traditional economic variables account for some, but not all, of these disparities. Since competition is relevant to labor market outcomes, researchers began to focus on how gender affects one's response to competition as a means of understanding persistent gender gaps in labor market outcomes [for review, see @Niederle2011]. Seminal work on gender differences in competitiveness operationalized competitiveness as the choice of a tournament payment scheme that reaps potentially higher earnings but requires outperforming an opponent over a piece-rate scheme [@Niederle2007]. This work found that women are less competitive than men, on average, even if they would have earned more by competing [@Niederle2007]. Additionally, this laboratory measure of competitiveness predicts labor market outcomes, such as education choices [@Buser2014; @Zhang2012], entrepreneurial decisions [e.g., investment, employment; @Berge2015], and earnings [@Reuben2015]. Thus, competitive preferences may contribute to gender differences in labor market outcomes [@Blau2017]. As such, it is important for organizations to take gender differences in competitiveness into consideration when striving to facilitate gender equality in workplace outcomes.  

Follow-up research with nearly identical procedures has replicated the effect of gender on the choice to opt into tournaments [see @Niederle2011 for review]. Notably, this effect has been replicated in diverse populations (e.g., across age groups and cultures) [@Apicella2015; @Buser2014; @Sutter2016; @Andersen2013; @Buser2017b; @Sutter2010; @Dreber2014; @Mayr2012] and with a diverse set of tasks [@Apicella2015; @Saccardo2018; @Bjorvatn2016; @Sutter2015; @Frick2011; @Samek2019]. However, there is evidence that the task used during competition affects the size of the gender gap. For instance, some research suggests that when the task is female-typed or gender-neutral, the gender gap in willingness to compete may be reduced or eliminated [@Iriberri2017; @Boschini2014; @Boschini2019; @Apicella2015; @Grosse2010; @Gunther2010; @Dreber2014; @Dreber2011; @Shurchkov2012]. Drawing from the psychology literature on stereotype threat [@Steele1997; @Spencer1999; @Spencer2016], negative stereotypes about women’s ability to perform male-typed tasks (e.g., math, mental rotation) may produce anxiety and undermine performance. As a result, women may decide not to engage in a competition because they either believe the stereotype or because the stereotype provokes enough anxiety to reduce performance [@Gunther2010; @Grosse2010; @Iriberri2017; @Shurchkov2012].  

Understanding how to address gender differences in competitiveness may be important for reducing gender inequality that persists today. When women compete less than their male counterparts, they may be missing crucial economic opportunities, as demonstrated by the evidence suggesting competitiveness is relevant to one’s economic outcomes [@Buser2014; @Zhang2012; @Reuben2015]. Given the importance of the gender gap in competition for women's economic outcomes, research has explored factors underlying gender differences in competitiveness. Notably, confidence and risk attitude have been implicated in driving the gender gap in willingness to compete [@Niederle2011; @Veldhuizen2017], although the extent to which confidence and risk attitude account for the gender gap in willingness to compete is debated. More specifically, the seminal research in this literature suggests that confidence and risk attitude do not completely explain the gender gap in the choice to compete, since there remains a residual gap in the choice to compete after controlling for these factors [@Niederle2007]. The unexplained component of the original gender effect was taken as evidence of a distinct "competitiveness" trait, separate from risk attitude and confidence [@Niederle2007; @Niederle2011]. However, recent work correcting for measurement error [@Gillen2019] and using experimental techniques to isolate the effects of the competitiveness trait [@Veldhuizen2017] suggests that risk attitude and confidence may fully explain the gender gap in the choice to compete. Regardless of whether competitiveness is a stand-alone trait, it is clear that confidence and risk attitude can generate differences in how men and women react to competitions. Thus, interventions designed to increase risk-taking or confidence in women may help reduce the gender difference in competitiveness.  

Confidence is conceptualized as the accuracy of one’s perceived performance or ability on a task [@Beyer1997]. Since competitions, by definition, compare the performance among two or more individuals, they naturally lead to self-evaluation and comparative judgments of self with others - processes that are intimately linked to confidence. There is ample research to suggest that women are less (over)confident on average than men across a number of domains [@Mobius2011; @Niederle2011; @Croson2009; @Lundeberg1994; @Niederle2007; @Bertrand2010a; @Beyer1990; @Beyer1997]. Within the literature on the gender gap in competitiveness, confidence is operationalized as the belief about one’s relative performance during a competition, where individuals who have inaccurately high ratings of their performance are deemed overconfident. If an individual does not feel as though their performance is higher than individuals they are competing against, they are unlikely to make the decision to compete for fear of missing the opportunity to earn money, even if they would otherwise outperform their opponent. Although both men and women tend to be overconfident, women are far less likely to fall into the trap of overconfidence, which leads them to compete less often than they should, given their actual ability [@Niederle2007]. 

Women’s relatively lower levels of confidence in their performance partly explains this gender difference [@Niederle2011], so it is important to understand factors that may affect confidence prior to the decision to compete. Confidence on a task can improve with preparation and training [@Gist1992; @Schunk1981; @Schunk1982; @Usher2008], since, in most cases, people are able to observe a gradual improvement in their skills over time. For instance, @Lent1996 found that college students listed past performance accomplishments as the most influential factor in determining their math skill confidence. Other research directly compared the effects of mastery experiences, vicarious experiences (e.g., watching others perform a task), and a control treatment without any intervention on confidence, finding that mastery increased confidence significantly more than vicarious experiences and the control treatment [@Bandura1977a]. Based on previous evidence of the benefits of enactive mastery through preparation and training on confidence, providing women with an adequate opportunity to prepare before a task may alleviate the gender gap in choice to compete.

Another variable that has been identified as a possible explanation for gender differences in competitiveness is risk attitude, typically construed as the preference for a certain gain over a gamble, even if the gamble has an equal or greater monetary expectation [@Kahneman1982]. Payment based on the outcomes of a competition are inherently riskier than non-competitive payment schemes (e.g., guaranteed payment per unit of output) because in most cases, there is uncertainty surrounding one's relative performance [@Niederle2011]. Several studies across diverse settings have documented a gender difference in risk attitudes, where women tend to be more risk-averse than men on average [@Bertrand2010a; @Croson2009; @Apicella2017]. Because competitions are riskier and women tend to be more risk-averse, women may be more likely to compete when they know they can prepare. Preparing may increase one's perceived likelihood of winning, and in turn, reduce the perceived risk of entering a competition.    

Notably, both knowing about an opportunity to prepare before competing and the actual act of preparing may encourage high-ability women to enter competitions more often. In knowing one can prepare beforehand, one may assume that they can resolve any discrepancies between their current ability and their desired ability level for competition by preparing. This knowledge, in and of itself, may be sufficient to reduce gender differences in competitiveness, regardless of whether women actually take advantage of this opportunity. Additionally, the act of preparation may be uniquely motivating, since preparation allows an individual to observe an improvement in their performance over time. As such, women may choose to compete more after preparing (i.e., practicing and/or studying). 

Here, we examined the role of preparation on the gender differences in willingness to compete through two experiments. In the first experiment, we tested whether simply knowing that there will be an opportunity to prepare before performing a task affects the gender gap in willingness to compete. That is, we manipulated participants’ knowledge of whether they had unlimited time to prepare before they made their decision to compete. We anticipated that participants with this information would be more inclined to compete compared to participants without this information. Thus, we expected an interaction between gender and condition on the choice to compete, along with a main effect of condition.

In the second experiment, we examined how actual preparation influences the decision to compete. That is, we manipulated whether participants were required to prepare before making this decision. Again, we expected that women in the preparation condition would be especially inclined to compete.

Across both studies, we also measured participants' lay beliefs about potential differences in decision to prepare and compete by monetarily incentivizing them to correctly predict which gender would prepare and compete more. The research design, hypotheses, measures and analyses were preregistered (https://osf.io/q39a5/) unless otherwise stated and all analyses were conducted in R statistical software (version `r paste0(R.Version()$major,".", R.Version()$minor)`).
