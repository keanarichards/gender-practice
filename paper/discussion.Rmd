REORDER BASED ON THIS: 

- For the discussion, I think it would be helpful to have a clearer
summary of the take homes across the three studies at the front end of
the discussion. If I understand our results correctly, that might be
something like this:
    - Past research suggests that women choose to compete less than men.
    This is a problem because they lose money. In our study, we don't find
    any evidence of this. Women are just as likely to compete. YET
    - In two out of three studies, we find that women spend more time preparing than men do. This is costly.
    - Across our studies, participants BELIEVE that women prepare more and compete less. These beliefs may be self-fulfilling (for normative reasons) and may indirectly make women feel like they need to/ are expected to prepare more, regardless of competition.



## Describing goals of research and main descriptive findings

Previous research suggests that women tend to be more risk-averse [@Croson2009; @Dohmen2011b; @Eckel2008; @Bertrand2010a] and less confident [@Bertrand2010; @Lundeberg1994; @Mobius2011; @Barber2001; @Croson2009], which affects their decisions to compete. Since confidence and risk attitudes may be affected by the opportunity to prepare, women may be more likely to compete when they have the opportunity to prepare before entering a competition. Through three experiments, we explored whether the opportunity to prepare affects gender differences in competitiveness and whether there are gender differences in tendency to prepare. 

First, we replicate the effect of gender on the choice to compete when gender is included as the only predictor in the model. In other words, women in our sample chose to compete less than men. The gender difference in the choice to compete goes away when controlling for task score, risk, and confidence across all three studies, suggesting that the effect of gender may be explained by other factors. 

Though the gender difference in competitiveness goes away when controlling for other predictors, we find evidence that gender consistently predicts risk and confidence across studies, replicating previous effects found within the literature [@Croson2009; @Dohmen2011b; @Eckel2008; @Bertrand2010a; @Bertrand2010; @Lundeberg1994; @Mobius2011; @Barber2001]. Next, we explored the effects of our preparation manipulations on the choice to compete across studies. 

## Summarizing effects of gender on practice 

Despite the lack of evidence for the effect of preparation on the choice to compete, we discovered a sizable gender difference in preparation. Here, we focus on the decision to practice problems as our main dependent variable, because it is the most consistent measure of preparation across all studies and had the most power across studies relative to other means of quantifying preparation (e.g., the number of practice problems left empty and the number of practice rounds completed). In Study 1, we found that women were 75.47% [DOUBLE CHECK] more likely to choose to complete practice problems compared to men. We replicated this finding in Study 2, where women were 18.62% [DOUBLE CHECK] more likely to choose to practice problems, even though half of participants were required to prepare for several rounds of practice beforehand. This effect holds despite no strong evidence that there is a gender difference in performance on the multiplication task and after controlling for participants' decision to compete. Importantly, across two out of the three studies, we find no gender difference in task performance when controlling for gender differences in risk and confidence, so the gender difference in the decision to practice does not seem to be driven by gender differences in the actual need to practice. Finding the effect of gender on the decision to practice is especially noteworthy because we are drawing from a participant pool (MTurk) where participants could be earning money for their participation through a nearly limitless supply of other studies, so the opportunity costs of preparing may be greater for MTurkers relative to other participant populations, suggesting that this effect could be even stronger when the opportunity costs are lower.

### Possible reasons for Study 3 deviation 

Notably, we do not replicate the effect of gender on the choice to practice problems in Study 3. Although we cannot be completely certain what may be underlying our inability to replicate the effect from the previous studies, we describe a few possible explanations here. First, Studies 1 and 2 measured the decision to complete practice problems *after* participants chose to compete, while Study 3 measured the decision to practice problems *before* the decision to compete, as necessitated by the main manipulation within the study. Thus, the differences in the results across studies could be explained by the effects of the decision to compete on the choice to practice that are not captured in Study 3. In other words, not knowing they might not have to compete could have reduced motivation to practice. There are also fewer participants that are offered the opportunity to practice in Study 3 (N = INSERT) relative to Studies 1 (N = INSERT) and 2 (N = INSERT) by nature of the study design (i.e., manipulating unlimited opportunity to prepare) so Study 3 likely had less power to detect the effect than previous studies. Finally, the structure of practicing itself varied across the three studies. For instance, Studies 1 and 2 did not offer participants the opportunity to study multiplication tables as a separate decision from the choice to practice problems, whereas in Study 3, participants were first asked whether they would like to study multiplication tables, *then* afterwards were asked whether they would like to practice problems. Perhaps being asked whether they would like to study before being asked whether they would like to practice problems reduced participants' interest in completing practice problems. Thus, like the gender difference in the choice to compete, it is likely that gender differences in preparation are shaped by context, INSERT BASED ON RESULTS FROM CHAPTER 2: as suggested by the findings in Chapter 2. 

### Describing previous literature with similar effects 

To our knowledge, these studies are the first to demonstrate a gender difference in preparation among adults who must explicitly opt into preparation. However, previous findings within educational contexts have found that women are more likely than men to value dedication and mastery [@Leslie2015; @Kenney-Benson2006], emphasize the importance of hard work [@Mccrea2008; @Hirt2009; @Mccrea2008a], and spend more time preparing than men for an intellectual evaluation when they were told that practice improved future performance [@Kimble2005]. For instance, in a study examining school-aged children’s approach to learning math, researchers found that girls, compared to boys, reported being more motivated to “master” their schoolwork and engage in more effortful learning strategies [@Kenney-Benson2006]. In one study looking at whether delaying competition affects gender differences in the willingness to compete while providing opportunity to study, @Charness2021 did not find a significant difference in the choice to prepare (*N* = 202). Although it is worth noting that, though the effect is non-significant, women are directionally more likely to prepare in their study. Since studying gender differences in the choice to prepare was not one of the main foci of their research, contrary to ours, it is entirely possible they did not have sufficient power to detect the effect of gender on the choice to prepare as a result. 

### Possible explanations for the gender difference in preparation

The gender difference in preparation observed in Studies 1 and 2 may be driven by women's relatively greater desire to reduce uncertainty around their future performance (given their greater average risk aversion) and/or increase their performance (given their lower average confidence). Indeed, mastery is an important driver of confidence [for review, see @Gist1992; @Usher2008]. While it is possible that confidence and risk aversion may be driving the gender difference in preparation, it is important to note that preparation in our studies did not increase competitiveness in either men or women. Because participants were able to choose to prepare in Study 2, we are unable to identify whether preparation causally affected confidence and/or risk aversion. Future work should examine the bidirectional relationships between confidence and preparation and risk and preparation.  Of course, other explanations for the gender differences in preparation may also exist, including relative differences in real or perceived opportunity costs, how rewarding it is to prepare, and/or enjoyment on the task, and we encourage future work to explore these alternative explanations.


## Summarizing effects of preparation condition on choice to compete

Across all three studies, we find no evidence that preparation increases men or women’s willingness to compete. In fact, in Study 3 we find that women in the control condition were significantly *more* likely to compete than women in the preparation condition, despite believing that practicing helps performance on the main task both based on their behavior and their responses to the manipulation check question. We explored whether the unexpected effect in Study 3  was driven by increased perceptions of risk or reduced confidence when participants were assigned to the practice condition relative to the control condition, and did not find strong evidence for either of those possible explanations. 

One possible reason women assigned to the preparation condition competed less is that they might not have felt as though they were practicing as much as others, leading them to avoid the competition altogether because they expected to be at a disadvantage if they had chosen to compete. That is, even though they might choose to practice multiplication problems, they still may not have felt like they practiced enough relative to others. It is possible that the unlimited nature of the preparation led participants to think more about how much they were preparing relative to others than they would have if all participants were required to practice for the same pre-determined amount of time (like in Study 2 = INSERT EMILY COMMENT = you haven't discussed study 2 yet though). It is also possible the unlimited nature of the preparation, in combination with perceptions of the limited ability of the control task to help with performance on the main task, may have led women in the control condition to feel less pressure to prepare for the task and as a result, led them to compete more because they felt ironically more prepared relative to women in the preparation condition.

Notably, this effect only holds among the subsample of participants that identify as women. When testing this hypothesis among the entire sample of participants, we do not find strong evidence that condition affects the decision to compete, similar to Studies 1 and 2. Thus, if the hypothesized explanation for the effect of the unlimited preparation condition on the choice to compete is valid, it is possible that women are especially susceptible to feelings of underpreparation relative to others when they have unlimited time to prepare, which may lead to a range of possible adverse outcomes, such as unnecessary overpreparation. Since we cannot directly test this hypothesis within the context of the current study, we include questions about perceptions of one's own preparation in the study in Chapter 2 and explore how gender relates to perceptions of relative preparation when participants are granted unlimited time to prepare within that chapter. 

## Summary of effects of perceptions of gender differences

Finally, we showed that participants accurately predicted the observed gender differences in preparation, regardless of their own choice to prepare or compete and despite thinking women and men perform equally well on the multiplication task. This suggests that they observe these gender differences in preparation directly in their own lives and/or have learned about stereotypes surrounding gender differences in preparation. There is extensive work suggesting that beliefs about identity-based behavior affect subsequent behavior [@Babcock2012; @Bowles2007; @Toosi2019; @Smith2014; @Benjamin2010c; @Bertrand2015; @Akerlof2000]. Thus, if future work confirms our hypothesis that women may be overpreparing (relative to their actual skill level) before performing, which may be exacerbated in competitive environments, it would be important to consider interventions that focus on changing beliefs about gender differences in preparation, perhaps by changing norms [@Miller2016], which has been shown to be an effective strategy for affecting subsequent behavior.

## Summary 

While we built off an extensive literature on gender differences in competitiveness, we have unearthed a new gender difference in preparation. As this is a new area of research, there are many promising and exciting avenues for future exploration, all of which have the potential to inform policy. First, future work should explore whether these results generalize to other populations and tasks. Second, future work should examine the impact of preparation on performance. Do women overprepare? Do men underprepare? What are the opportunity costs of preparing? Also, it would be important to think about ways that women could be equally rewarded *without* having to compete - that is, reimagining how to support women being productive in ways that work for them. And finally, how do competitions themselves affect gender differences in the choice to prepare? 

Much of the research on gender differences in competitiveness is focused on designing interventions to increase women’s competitiveness, with less attention paid to potential downstream consequences of these interventions. Here we show that preparation has no impact on willingness to compete, while discovering a gender difference in preparation, along with robust perceptions of gender differences in preparation. Future work should explore the implications of these findings further in organizational contexts, where these effects may have a long-lasting impact on gender differences in economic outcomes.

We also find evidence that competition choice is related to the decision to spend extra time practicing, such that participants across both genders included in the study who chose to compete are more likely to choose to practice relative to participants who chose the piece rate payment scheme. Thus, it is possible that the observed gender difference in preparation could be exacerbated when participants are required to compete, which we experimentally test in Chapter 2 of this dissertation.
