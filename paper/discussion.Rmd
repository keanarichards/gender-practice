Previous research suggests that women tend to be more risk-averse [@Croson2009; @Dohmen2011b; @Eckel2008; @Bertrand2010a] and less confident [@Bertrand2010; @Lundeberg1994; @Mobius2011; @Barber2001; @Croson2009], which affects their decisions to compete. Since confidence and risk attitude may be affected by the opportunity to prepare, women may be more likely to compete when they have the opportunity to prepare before entering a competition. Through two experiments, we explored whether the opportunity to prepare affects gender differences in competitiveness and whether there are gender differences in willingness to prepare. Most notably, we discovered and then replicated a sizable gender difference in the willingness to prepare for a multiplication task, even though women chose to compete less and even after all participants were required to prepare. 

Although previous findings within educational contexts are suggestive of gender differences in willingness to prepare (e.g., greater motivation to master schoolwork and engage in effortful learning strategies) [@Kenney-Benson2006], our studies are the first to demonstrate a gender difference in preparation among adults who must explicitly opt into preparation. This effect is especially noteworthy since we are drawing from a participant pool (MTurk) where participants could be earning money for their participation through a nearly limitless supply of other studies, so any possible opportunity costs of choosing to spend extra time preparing are more palpable than in other contexts.

The observed gender difference in the willingness to prepare may be driven by women's greater desire (relative to men) to reduce uncertainty around their future performance (given their greater average risk aversion) and/or increase their perceived ability (given their lower average confidence). Indeed, mastery is an important driver of confidence [for review, see @Gist1992; @Usher2008] and there is no theoretical or empirical reason to suspect that women would be less concerned with mastery than men. In fact, research suggests that women are just as likely as men to compete when competing against their own past performance, suggesting an equal desire for self-improvement [@Apicella2017a].

Alternatively, women may intrinsically value practicing more than men. There is a small literature suggesting that women are more likely than men to value dedication and mastery [@Leslie2015; @Kenney-Benson2006], emphasize the importance of hard work [@Mccrea2008; @Hirt2009; @Mccrea2008a], and spend more time preparing than men in general [@Kimble2005]. For instance, in a study examining school-aged children’s approach to learning math, researchers found that girls, compared to boys, reported being more motivated to “master” their schoolwork and engage in more effortful learning strategies [@Kenney-Benson2006]. 

We also found that neither the knowledge of the opportunity to prepare nor the act of preparation itself affected participants' willingness to compete, which was surprising, given the previous literature suggesting that mastery is one of the most important determinants of confidence in tasks [for review, see @Gist1992; @Usher2008]. Since confidence and risk attitude were measured after providing the additional option to prepare, we cannot identify whether these factors drove the null effect of condition. It is possible that the opportunity to prepare may have made participants more aware of the discrepancy between their current ability and their desired ability threshold for preparation. This increased awareness of the discrepancy may have affected participants' confidence and/or risk attitude, in turn negating any benefits of the opportunity to prepare on the decision to compete. We intend to explore this possibility in a future study. Finally, we showed that participants accurately predicted the observed gender differences in behavior, suggesting that they observe these behaviors directly in their own lives and/or have learned about stereotypes surrounding these behaviors. There is extensive work suggesting that beliefs about identity-based behavior actually affect behavior [@Babcock2012; @Bowles2007; @Toosi2019; @Smith2014; @Benjamin2010c; @Bertrand2015; @Akerlof2000]. If participants accurately predict gender differences in preparation and competition, it would suggest that any observed gender differences in behavior may be generalizable to other contexts. 

In both cases, participants' accuracy in predicting the gender differences in competitiveness and preparation would suggest that these are not isolated findings, but in fact are representative of gender differences in other contexts, such as organizations. Since the choice to compete and prepare have the potential to affect employees' success within organizations, our findings suggest that organizational decisions and communication should account for these gender differences to reduce persistent gender gaps in labor market outcomes. 

## Implications of opportunity costs of overpreparing before competitions   

Competitions are increasingly prevalent in the global labor market [@Lavy2004; @Lemiuex2009] and the winners of competitions are disproportionately rewarded [@Frank2010]. Understanding individual differences in response to competitive situations may help address economic disparities across groups, like persistent gender differences in labor market outcomes [@Blau2017; @Altonji1999]. For instance, one step to improve gender equality within organizations is to take these gender differences into account when making decisions on how to organize reward structures and communicate these structures to employees.  

Much of the research on gender differences in competitiveness is focused on designing interventions to increase women’s competitiveness, with less attention paid to potential downstream consequences of these interventions. Yet, understanding how women and men respond to competitions may also be crucial for organizations across contexts to address gender disparities in labor market outcomes. If competitions exacerbate gender differences in the amount of effort exerted (e.g., preparing or studying) before performance, this may affect women’s labor output, career advancement, the ability to achieve a satisfying work-life balance, and even the decision to enter or stay in competitive environments. Additionally, there are opportunity costs for expending more effort than necessary on only one task or skill, especially when an individual's overall performance is evaluated based on their success across many domains. These effects are especially relevant to professional development in STEM fields, where gender disparities are arguably driven by gender differences in confidence [@Cheryan2017], increasing the likelihood women will overprepare before competition. 

Relatedly, if women *expect* that they will prepare more in competitive environments, this may, in turn, impact whether they even enter competitive environments. In fact, there is evidence that the way a job is advertised affects women's willingness to apply [@Gaucher2011; @Flory2010]. If a job is described as "competitive" or the payment scheme is described as a competition, women find the jobs less appealing and are less willing to apply, demonstrating the power of organizational communication on gender differences in labor market outcomes. While our work suggests that merely giving women more time to prepare does not make them more willing to compete, anticipated effort could still influence labor market outcomes by affecting women’s decisions to enter certain fields or compete for promotions, for instance. In our studies, we use relatively unimportant tasks that are unlikely to greatly impact one’s earnings. Yet, we still find a striking gender difference in preparation, suggesting that our study likely *underestimates* this gender difference. For instance, we would expect greater gender differences in preparation for tasks with higher stakes, where the outcomes are important for one’s career and economic prospects. In this way, our study is providing a conservative test of the gender differences in effort and preparation in the real world. 

## Future research

There are a number of avenues for future research in this area. First, we would like to test the robustness of gender differences in preparation outside of online and laboratory settings. Do these findings replicate in organizations? Exploring the gender difference in preparation cross-culturally would also shed light on the universality of the finding and help to identify cultural, ecological and social factors that exacerbate it.

A second important extension of the work would be to examine how anticipated preparation or workload influences women’s decisions to enter competitive environments. While we did not find that giving women time to prepare makes them more likely to compete, it is still possible that women know that they will end up preparing more in competitive situations and thus, select out of them. As mentioned earlier, there are opportunity costs to overpreparing. 

A third extension of the current work would be to examine whether women are overpreparing. Does preparation negatively impact women? Does it help women? To determine whether men or women are preparing more (or less) than needed, future research should test whether gender and time chosen to prepare interact to affect a participants’ probability of winning a competition [see @Niederle2007]. Another follow-up study could manipulate whether there is a monetary cost for preparing to explore whether gender differences in the choice to prepare persist despite a clear cost, and whether this leads to gender differences in earnings within the study. 

It would also be interesting to explore whether norms about gender affect decisions to compete. Norms are important drivers of human behavior [@Schultz2007], so it is entirely plausible that the decision to compete and prepare might be fueled in part by what most women or men are doing, or perceptions of gender differences in these behaviors. Although there is some work exploring how gender norms affect actual behavior [@Babcock2012; @Bowles2007; @Toosi2019; @Smith2014; @Bertrand2015; @Akerlof2000], our evidence of participants' lay beliefs about gender differences suggests that this is an important avenue for future research. Additionally, our findings cannot speak to whether the decision to prepare directly improved participants' performance. Future research should manipulate whether participants have the opportunity to prepare without providing the option for additional practice thereafter to explore the benefits of preparing on performance, which may negate any opportunity costs of preparing. 

While we build off an extensive and laudable literature on gender differences in competitiveness, we have unearthed a gender difference in preparation. As this is a new area of research, there are many promising and exciting avenues for future exploration, all of which have the potential to inform governmental and organizational policies that ultimately mitigate gender disparities in the labor market.
