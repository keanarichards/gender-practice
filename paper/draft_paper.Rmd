abstract: |
  Previous research suggests that women compete less than men, even when there are no gender differences in performance. Womenâ€™s reluctance to compete can lead to lower earnings and may contribute to the pernicious gender wage gap. We conducted three experiments involving over X participants recruited from an online marketplace to causally test whether preparation for a task can reduce gender differences in competitiveness by increasing women's willingness to compete. We test this hypothesis in three different ways using a multiplication task. Specifically, we test whether the gender difference in willingness to compete is reduced by 1) informing participants about an opportunity to practice (Study 1), 2) by providing participants with an opportunity to practice a limited number of problems (Study 2), and 3) by providing participants with an opportunity to practice an unlimited number of problems (Study 3). Contrary to our hypotheses, we find no evidence, in any of the studies, that preparation affects willingness to compete in either men or women. Importantly, however, we uncover a sizable gender gap in preparation, where, depending on the study, women are between X% and X% more likely to prepare than men, regardless of whether they choose to compete. This gender difference in preparation also aligns with participants' incentivized beliefs. More than 75% of participants in each study correctly guessed that women would prepare more than men. Our findings suggest that preparation is ineffective at reducing the gender gap in competitiveness. Instead, we uncover a sizable gender difference in preparation. Given the potential opportunity costs associated with preparing, future work should examine whether women overprepare relative to men.
