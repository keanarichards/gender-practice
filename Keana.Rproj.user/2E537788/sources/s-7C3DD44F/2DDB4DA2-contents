### Pre-registered analyses^[All hypotheses were pre-registered (https://osf.io/q39a5/) unless otherwise stated and all analyses were conducted in R.]

Primary hypothesis 1: We do not find evidence of a significant interaction between gender and condition on the decision to compete `r apa_print(primary_hyp1)$full_result$conditionpract_genderWoman` (see Figure \@ref(fig:s100)). Unlike the pilot study, we found that men were significantly more likely to choose to compete, where `r ctable(clean$gender, clean$comp_choice)$proportions[4]*100`% of men chose to compete compared to `r ctable(clean$gender, clean$comp_choice)$proportions[5]*100`% of women, `r apa_print(primary_hyp1)$full_result$genderWoman`. 


```{r s100, fig.cap="Proportion of participants who chose to compete based on participant gender and condition. Error bars represent standard errors."}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("study1", "figs", "fig00_comp-choice-by-gender-and-cond-bar.png"))

```

```{r, results = "asis"}
print(stby(list(clean$gender, clean$condition), INDICES = clean$comp_choice, FUN = ctable))
```


Primary hypothesis 2: As hypothesized, women were `r (exp(coef(primary_hyp2))[2] - 1)*100`% more likely to take advantage of the opportunity to practice relative to men, `r apa_print(primary_hyp2)$full_result$genderWoman`, while controlling for the decision to compete (see Figure \@ref(fig:s101)). As an exploratory analysis, we tested whether gender and the choice to compete interact to predict the choice to prepare, but did not find evidence for an interaction, `r apa_print(sec_exploratory2)$full_result$genderWoman_comp_choicetournament`. 

```{r s101, fig.cap="Proportion of participants who chose to prepare based on participant gender and choice to compete. Error bars represent standard errors."}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("study1", "figs", "fig01_pract-choice-by-gender-and-comp-choice-bar.png"))

```


```{r t1, results = "asis"}
print(stby(list(clean$gender, clean$comp_choice), INDICES = clean$pract_choice, FUN = ctable))

```



Primary hypothesis 3: In concordance with our pre-registered hypothesis, women  completed `r (exp(coef(primary_hyp3))[2] - 1)*100`% more rounds of preparation relative to men, `r apa_print(primary_hyp2)$full_result$genderWoman` (see Figure \@ref(fig:s102)). 


```{r s102, fig.cap="Average (log-transformed) practice count based on participant gender and competition choice. Error bars represent standard errors."}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("study1", "figs", "fig02_total-rev-count-by-gender-comp-choice.png"))


```


Primary hypothesis 4: As hypothesized, participants expected women to spend more time preparing for the multiplication task relative to men, `r apa_print(primary_hyp4, n= nrow(clean))$statistic` (see Figure \@ref(fig:s103)). 


```{r s103, fig.cap="Participants' perceptions of gender differences in the choice to practice on the task. Error bars represent standard errors."}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("study1", "figs", "fig03_perc-task-gender-pract.png"))

```

```{r, results = "asis"}
print(ctable(clean$gender, clean$perc_task_gender_pract))
```

Exploratory analysis 7a: Participants did not expect any gender differences in performance on the task, `r apa_print(exploratory7a, n = nrow(clean))$statistic` (see Figure \@ref(fig:s104)). 

```{r s104, fig.cap="Participants' perceptions of gender differences in performance on the task. Error bars represent standard errors."}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("study1", "figs", "fig04_better-gender-guess.png"))

```

```{r, results = "asis"}
print(ctable(clean$gender, clean$better_gender_guess))
```


Exploratory analysis 7b: Participants were significantly more likely to expect men to choose to compete more often, `r apa_print(exploratory7b, n = nrow(clean))$statistic` (see Figure \@ref(fig:s105)). 

```{r s105, fig.cap="Participants' perceptions of gender differences in choice to compete. Error bars represent standard errors."}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("study1", "figs", "fig05_perc-gender-comp.png"))

```

```{r, results = "asis"}
print(ctable(clean$gender, clean$perc_gender_comp))
```


Exploratory analysis 7c: Participants were significantly more likely to expect women to choose to prepare in general, `r apa_print(exploratory7c, n = nrow(clean))$statistic` (see Figure \@ref(fig:s106)).

```{r s106, fig.cap="Participants' perceptions of general gender differences in choice to practice. Error bars represent standard errors."}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("study1", "figs", "fig06_perc-gen-gender-pract.png"))

```

```{r, results = "asis"}
print(ctable(clean$gender, clean$perc_gen_gender_pract))
```
