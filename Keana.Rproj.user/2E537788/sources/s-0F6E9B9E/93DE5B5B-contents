# Facilities, equipment, and other resources

Ms. Richards has support from several knowledgeable mentors, including her adviser, Dr. Coren Apicella, Associate Professor of Psychology, who has extensive experience conducting research on social and economic preferences using economic games [e.g., @Apicella2020; @Apicella2017a; @Apicella2015; @Apicella2011; @Apicella2017; @Apicella2012; @Apicella2014a]. Dr. Apicella is founder and co-director of the Social and Behavioral Science Initiative (SBSI) at the University of Pennsylvania, which supports research through shared laboratory space, equipment, and research assistants, while fostering interdisciplinary discussion through weekly brown bags. Ms. Richards is an active participant in SBSI activities and events. 

All studies will be completed on Qualtrics survey software, which both Dr. Apicella and Ms. Richards have access to, along with around-the-clock access to the Qualtrics support team. To mediate the recruitment process on Amazon Mechanical Turk, Ms. Richards has a Turkprime account, which has features to prevent repeated participation (e.g., checks for duplicate IP addresses), prevent bots from contaminating data collection (e.g., checks for duplicate geolocations), and verify worker information. Although the initial research will take place online, Dr. Apicella and Ms. Richards have access to the Benjamin Franklin Laboratory and the William Penn Laboratory for participant recruitment, which include 34 networked computers, removable privacy shields, and noise canceling headphones. Ms. Richards also has access to three participant pools for recruitment: the psychology student pool who receive credit for participating in research, and two paid participant pools maintained by SBSI and the Wharton Behavioral Laboratory. Finally, Dr. Apicella and Ms. Richards have access to additional support, if needed, including several grant managers, IT support specialists, administrators, a business office manager, and undergraduate research assistants.
