## Synergistic activities

*Teaching* 

- I have taught 200 students in Social Psychology about the principles of intergroup biases for 1.5 hour invited lectures (4/9/2019 & 11/7/2019), including concepts which overlap with the current research. 

- I organized and led data management training in R for 10 research assistants in the Social and Behavioral Science Initiative (2019). During the training, I taught students the principles of cleaning data, including data selection, filtering, arrangement, mutation, and summarization, using the tidy packages in R. 

*Mentorship* 

- I serve as a mentor for underrepresented students in STEM through the University of Pennsylvania’s College Achievement Program Graduate School Mentoring Initiative. As a mentor, I assist, fellow, Black female students navigate the graduate school application process during one-on-one monthly meetings.  
- I have mentored a female honor student on her senior thesis. The study examined men’s reactions to competitive wins and losses.
