# Meeting goals
Feedback on dissertation proposal




???

Hi everyone, so today we'll be chatting about steps to move forward with my dissertation. There is a requirement in the psych dept to submit a dissertation proposal at some point after my qualifying exams and before I defend. I don't have to defned the proposal formally, but I have to discuss the proposal with the committee either via email or in person - I thought it'd be easier to talk about it via videocall. Once I have approval, Geoff has to let Sara know that the committee approves the proposal. This proposal serves as a 2-4pg contract, essentially saying that if I follow what I say I will do in the proposal, I will be able to move forward with the defense. 
So with that in mind, here are the required parts of the proposal from the grad student manual: 
- The dissertation proposal should briefly describe click (a) the gap in knowledge the thesis research will fill, click (b) the research question(s) that will be answered in the thesis work, click (c) the study design(s) or research methods, and click (d) the hypotheses the student plans to test (if appropriate to the study design). (click) The proposal should also include an outline of the chapters that will be included in the dissertation

# Gap in knowledge






???
So let's start with the gap in the knowledge that my thesis aims to address first. Previous research suggests that women compete less than men, even when there are no gender differences in performance (see Niederle &amp; Vesterlund, 2011 for review). Women’s reluctance to compete may contribute to persistent gender differences in labor market outcomes (Berge, Bjorvatn, Garcia Pires, &amp; Tungodden, 2015; Buser, Niederle, &amp; Oosterbeek, 2014; Reuben, Sapienza, &amp; Zingales, 2015; Zhang, 2012), such as the gender wage gap, with men earning more than women, on average (Blau &amp; Kahn, 2017). One mechanism for gender differences in competitiveness is confidence, which leads women to undercompete and men to overcompete (relative to their performance level) (Niederle &amp; Vesterlund, 2007; van Veldhuizen, 2017).  Based on previous evidence of the benefits of enactive mastery through preparation and training on confidence (Bandura, Adams, &amp; Beyer, 1977; Gist &amp; Mitchell, 1992; Lent, Brown, Gover, &amp; Nijjer, 1996; Schunk, 1981, 1982; Usher &amp; Pajares, 2008), providing women with an adequate opportunity to prepare before a task may alleviate the gender gap in the choice to compete. Surprisingly, little work has explored how preparation differentially impacts men and women’s willingness to compete.

# Chapter 1 


&lt;img src="libs/img/widen-gap.jpg" width="1600" /&gt;

insert diagram with 3 different ways of measuring preparation -&gt; gender gap in competitiveness  

???
This is where Chapter 1 of my dissertation comes in. I attempt to fill this gap in the knowledge base by exploring the effect of the opportunity to prepare (conceptualized in 3 different ways) on the gender gap in competitiveness. Since I am giving participants opportunities to prepare in these studies, I also explore whether women may spend more time using the available opportunity to prepare in general than men in this chapter. I've already run two studies out of the 3 I propose for this chapter of the dissertation, so I'll give you a quick review of those results before describing the plan for the third study I will run in this chapter.

# RQ and hypotheses

- Does the opportunity to prepare affect gender differences in competitiveness?

--

  - Studies 1 and 2: Yes.
    
--

  - Study 3: No. 

--

- Are there gender differences in willingness to prepare?

--
    - Studies 1-3: Yes. 


???
To make this explicit, the main RQs I'll be addressing in Chapter 1 through 3 experiments is: Does the opportunity to prepare (either in the form of knowledge of the opportunity, limited preparation, or unlimited preparation) affect gender differences in competitiveness? 

- I originally expected in studies 1 and 2 that, yes, women would be especially likely to compete in the condition when they had the opportunity to prepare before making the decision to compete. However, as I'll soon show, I do not have evidence for this hypothesis, so in the third study, I'm expecting to replicate the null effect. 


Are there gender differences in willingness to prepare?

- Throughout these studies, I am hypothesizing that women will be more likely to use the opportunity to prepare than men in general.

Since the methods across all of these studies are pretty much identical with the exception of the manipulation - I'll present the methods in one go here. 

I recruit participants on Mturk and they are told in advance that they will complete a series of paid multiplication problems.

Half of the participants have the opportunity to prepare (manipulated in 1 of 3 ways) while they make this choice, and the other half don't. 

Then, they decide whether their performance on the upcoming multiplication task follow either a competitive tournament or noncompetitive piece rate payment scheme. This is how competitiveness is typically operationalized in this literature - a measure that has been shown to map onto competitive behavior outside of the lab (EG etc.). 

This is how the question is usually presented: Imagine you are paid to complete a task where you can choose between 2 different payment schemes for your performance: (CLICK) $1 per question correct or (CLICK) $2 per question correct, but only if you beat someone else that is also completing the task. (CLICK) Which option do you think you would prefer? The more competitive one where you are paid double the amount but must win in a tournament or the non-competitive one where you are paid for your performance completed regardless of how other people do? 

In our case, we offer participants $.10 per correct under the piece rate payment scheme, and $.20 per correct for the tournament payment scheme. 

After they make this decision, we give all participants the option to practice before they complete the paid multiplication task. If they choose to prepare, participants are presented with each multiplication table, 1 through 12, in sequential order. Each multiplication table provides products of numbers up to 12. Thus, participants could use the table to study. Additionally, participants are asked if they want to complete practice problems. If they say yes, participants are asked to solve all multiples in that table and can only proceed to the next table if they answer all the questions correctly. Once they complete all practice questions for a given times table, they are shown the
multiplication table again and asked if they would like to continue solving problems from
that table or move onto the next multiplication table. This process is repeated for each
multiplication table. Thus, we have two measures of preparation behavior: the decision to practice
and the total number of times participants completed each multiplication table. The decision to
practice measure conceptually captures a participants’ baseline willingness to prepare, before
they know what the preparation will involve. Thereafter, the total number of preparation rounds
reflects participants’ willingness to repeatedly prepare

Following the preparation portion of the study, participants moved on to the paid portion
of the study. They were required to solve as many problems as possible in two minutes and then they answered some follow up questions

On the next set of slides, I'll discuss the main results from Studies 1 and 2 of this chapter.

# Results: Condition and gender -&gt; Competition 


???
First, one of my pre-registered hypotheses was that women would be especially likely to compete when they have the opportunity to prepare. (CLICK)

Summary for panel 1:
This first panel shows the effect of gender and condition the proportion of participants who choose to compete in Study 1 - which is where I manipulated whether participants knew in advance that they would be able to prepare before they decided to compete or not. 

Contrary to our predictions, we do not find evidence of a
significant interaction between gender and condition on the decision to compete, 𝑏 = 0.06, 95%
CI [−0.63, 0.76], 𝑧 = 0.18, 𝑝 = .861 (see Figure 1), suggesting that women in the knowledge of
preparation condition were not uniquely more inclined to compete.

Summary for panel 2: 

In this second panel, I'm only showing the effect of condition among women (so you'll note that the sample size represented in this graph is smaller because I'm only using about half of the sample in this plot). We pre-registered a slightly different analysis in this study (e.g., a two-proportions z-test among women with condition &amp; choice to compete as the main vars of interest instead of a logistic regression with an interaction between gender and condition on the choice to compete) - based on the idea that our hypothesis is primarily focused on the effect of condition on women. Either way, the results are essentially the same, -- we do not find evidence that the preparation condition (in this havingt he opportunity to complete a set number of problems before choosing to compete) increased women's willingness to compete. If anything, the effect was in the opposite of the expected direction.

# Results: Gender -&gt; Preparation 

???
Okay so overall these analyses suggest that the opp to prepare does not affect the gender gap in choice to compete. Another hypothesis we pre-registered was that women would be more likely to prepare in general than men. For the next step of plots, I'll be focusing on the average number of practice rounds that participants opted into as the main metric of the choice to prepare. In study 1, with the knowledge of prep cond, we find that women across both types of payment schemes are more likely to prepare before the upcoming math task compared to men. 

(CLICK) And even when half of participants were fprced to prep in the limited prep cond during study 2, we still find that women are practicing more.

# Next steps


???
Study 3 (currently in progress) seeks to replicate the null effect of preparation on the gender gap in competitiveness and test whether the gender difference in willingness to prepare holds using a third &amp; final manipulation: unlimited preparation. In Study 3, participants will be randomly assigned to either a condition where they will be told they can prepare as long as they want (unlimited preparation) or complete as many rounds of a counting task as they want (control) before they decide whether to compete  

Alright before I move onto chapter 2, I'm going to pause here to see if there are any pressing comments or questions that would be essential to address in the dissertation proposal. 


---

# Chapter 2 



???
In Chapter 2, I will test whether competition exacerbates the gender difference in preparation I observed in Chatper 1. given previous research suggesting women are more averse to competition, driven by their greater risk aversion and lower confidence on average, I am expecting that women, compared to men, would be especially likely to prepare before entering competitive environments  (Gillen, Snowberg, &amp; Yariv, 2019; Niederle &amp; Vesterlund, 2011; van Veldhuizen, 2017).

# RQ and hypotheses

- Does competition exacerbate gender differences in preparation?

--

  - Yes. 
    
???
So the main question I'm interested in answering is: Does competition exacerbate gender differences in preparation? and I expect the answer to be yes. I'll test thsi hypothesis through one study - using the following design:

# Methods

<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-11d7c42cce3f909bce6d">{"x":{"diagram":"digraph flowchart {\n      # node definitions with substituted label text\n      graph [fontname = Helvetica, overlap = true, fontsize = 10, nodesep = .1, penwidth = 2.0]\n\n      node [shape = rectangle]        \n      tab1 [label = \"MTurk\"]\n      tab2 [label = \"Competition\"]\n      tab3 [label = \"No competition\"]\n      tab4 [label = \"Choice to practice\"]\n      tab5 [label = \"Optional practice\"]\n      tab6 [label = \"Paid task\"]\n\n      # edge definitions with the node IDs\n      tab1 -> tab3;\n      tab1 -> tab2;\n      tab2 -> tab4;\n      tab3 -> tab4;\n      tab4 -> tab5;\n      tab5 -> tab6 }","config":{"engine":"dot","options":null}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
&lt;/center&gt;

???
If the methods I'm about to describe sound familiar to you - this is the first study of my NSF - so I'm just going to review the methods here for you all.

Participants recruited on Amazon Mechanical Turk will be required to follow either a competitive tournament payment scheme or non-competitive piece-rate payment scheme. 

Participants will earn $.10 per question correct if they win under a tournament payment scheme and $.05 under a piece-rate payment scheme.


Then, participants will be provided the opportunity to spend as much time preparing for their paid performance as they would like. I expect to replicate the main effect of gender on preparation observed in Studies 1-3 of Chapter 1, and more notably, I expect to find that the gender difference in preparation is exacerbated under the competitive payment scheme.

# Overall (anticipated) takeaways 

- Preparation does not reduce gender gap in competitiveness 

- Women prepare more than men in general (possibly exacerbated by competition)


???
Together, the anticipated results would suggest that preparation is not only ineffective at reducing the gender gap in competitiveness, but that opportunities to prepare may inadvertently lead to a gender gap in preparation (with implications for opportunity costs of overpreparing), especially in competitive contexts. The hypothesized effect of competitive environments is in line with previous research suggesting that context is crucial in understanding gender differences in economic outcomes (Andersen, Ertac, Gneezy, &amp; List, 2017; Andersen, Ertac, Gneezy, List, &amp; Maximiano, 2013; Balafoutas &amp; Sutter, 2012; He, Kang, &amp; Lacetera, 2019; Niederle, Segal, &amp; Vesterlund, 2013). By shedding light on the potential downstream consequences of interventions to increate women’s competitiveness (e.g., overpreparing), these findings have important implications for understanding how organizational structure may affect women and men differently, and in turn, affect gender differences in economic outcomes.
