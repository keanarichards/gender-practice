There is no evidence that the manipulation of the limited opportunity to prepare condition affected participants' choice to compete, nor did we find evidence of the anticipated interaction effect between gender and condition. Thus, it appears that gender differences in competitiveness are unaffected by having had the opportunity to prepare for a limited, pre-specified amount of time.   

In fact, the gender difference in competitiveness itself, like in Study 1, does not hold when risk attitudes, confidence, and task scores are included in the model, suggesting the difference was fully explained those variables. In this way, our study deviates from previous research suggesting that competitiveness is a stand-alone trait [@Niederle2007], and is more in line with recent evidence that competitiveness is fully explained by other factors (e.g., confidence or risk attitudes) [@Gillen2019; @Veldhuizen2017]. In line with this argument, we replicate the finding both within the literature and in the previous study that women are more risk averse and less confident than men. 

Contrary to Study 1, the gender differences in task scores observed when gender is included as the only predictor appears to be explained by differences in risk attitudes and confidence, since the effect of gender on task score is no longer significant when those predictors are included in the model. Thus, based on these first two set of results, it is not entirely clear yet if there are gender differences in performance on the multiplication task used in the study. 

Even though we do not have evidence within the context of this study that there is a gender difference in competitiveness or performance on the multiplication task when controlling for other variables, women still chose to prepare more than men - regardless of which payment scheme they ultimately selected, their risk attitudes, confidence, or task scores. At the same time, we have evidence that the choice to compete in general is related to a participants' choice to prepare, such that individuals who chose the competitive payment scheme chose to prepare at higher rates than those who chose the non-competitive payment scheme. We replicate the effects found in Study 1 when asking participants about their perceptions of these gender differences in performance, competitiveness, and preparation, such that participants were 1) significantly more likely to say that women prepare more than men both in general and on the multiplication task, despite 2) competing less and 3) performing just as well as men. 

Finally, we explore the new post-manipulation measures that are specific to this study. First, we find that preparedness is related to the choice to prepare. In light of the other findings, this result implies that feelings of preparedness do not derive from the required amount of preparation that one completes (that is. random assignment to condition within the context of this study), but instead, the choice to spend extra time preparing over and above what is required. Additionally, the fact that gender does not predict feelings of preparedness, despite women choosing to prepare more, has potentially important implications if replicated. That is, women may prepare more than men, yet still feel as though they are less prepared relative to others. We explore this possibility in the study of Chapter 2. Assuming the set of results using these measures are true and would replicate, they would suggest that women's greater decisions to prepare, only get them to a feeling of preparedness that is not significantly different than men's, if they do have effects on feelings of preparedness at all. However, it is unclear whether the choice to prepare may be related to other variables not captured in this study that predict feelings of preparedness. Thus, future studies should explore women and men's feelings of preparedness both before and after the choice to prepare as a way to try to address the question of what is driving the effect. 

On top of the question about feelings of preparedness after completing the practice and task itself, we also asked participants to indicate their feelings about the multiplication task itself, and more specifically, how fatigued they felt after completing the task and how interested they were in the task. With regards to the question about fatigue, both participants in the limited preparation condition and participants who chose to prepare reported significantly higher levels of fatigue than participants who did not choose to prepare. Yet, women did not report feeling significantly more fatigued than men, despite, again, choosing to prepare at significantly higher rates. Thus, women's higher rates of preparation did not seem to have negative effects on at least our one measure attempting to capture potential negative effects of preparing. 
Finally, we show that gender does not predict field-specific ability beliefs - in other words, men and women's emphasis on the importance of hard work for success (at least within the domain of math), do not appear to be significantly different (INSERT confirm this is what FAB is capturing). This is the only study in the dissertation that includes these measures, and as such, replication of these results would be important to confirm they are not false positives [@Coffman2015].
