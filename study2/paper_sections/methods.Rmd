Participants were recruited on Amazon Mechanical Turk using the same pre-screening criteria as Study 1. The final sample consisted of `r nrow(clean)` participants (`r freq(clean$gender, report.nas = F)[6]`% women), with an average age of `r mean(clean$age, na.rm = T)` (*SD* = `r sd(clean$age, na.rm = T)`) years. 

As in Study 1, participants included in the study were told they would be completing a two-minute multiplication task (identical to the one used in Study 1) and would be able to choose a payment scheme for their performance. After being told about the rules for the multiplication task and passing comprehension questions, participants were assigned to either a preparation condition, where they were told they would complete several rounds of practice before completing the multiplication task, or a control condition, where they were told they would complete several rounds of a counting task before moving on. As in Study 1, participants were randomly assigned to each condition based on their indicated gender. The participants in the preparation condition completed 12 rounds (one round per multiplication table), with 6 problems per round. The problems for each round were selected at random. For the counting task, participants in the control condition were asked to complete 5 questions where they counted the number of zeros in a matrix of zeros and ones. After a 30-second break following completion of their respective tasks, all participants chose a payment scheme for the multiplication task (order of presentation was randomized) and completed the paid multiplication task for two minutes. We included many of the same follow-up questions as in Study 1, including risk aversion, confidence, and perceptions of gender differences in preparation, competitiveness, and performance. We also asked participants if they wished they had more time to prepare for the multiplication task and included measures of their fatigue, field-specific ability beliefs, and interest in the multiplication task all on 1 (Strongly disagree) to 7 (Strongly agree) scales. For the fatigue scale, participants rated how fatigued and mentally exhausted they felt. Participants indicated the degree to which they "enjoyed completing the multiplication task" for the interest scale. Finally, to measure field-specific ability beliefs, we asked participants how much they perceived success in math depends on ability versus effort through six questions (e.g., "If you want to succeed in math, hard work alone just won't cut it; you need to have an innate gift or talent").
