#### Describing main variables of interest

We start by exploring gender differences across the main variables of interest to compare the characteristics of our sample to previous samples in the literature and provide context for the subsequent analyses. First, we replicated the effect from the previous studies of gender on the choice to compete when gender is included as the only predictor in the logistic regression: `r ctable(clean_fraud_removed$gender, clean_fraud_removed$comp_choice, useNA = "no")$proportions[4]*100`% of men chose to compete compared to `r ctable(clean_fraud_removed$gender, clean_fraud_removed$comp_choice, useNA = "no")$proportions[5]*100`% of women, `r apa_print(exploratory16)$full_result$genderWoman`. However, like the previous two studies, when running regressions including control variables (i.e., task score, risk attitudes, confidence, and the interaction between gender and condition), we find that the effect of gender on the choice to compete is not significant, `r apa_print(hypothesis3c)$full_result$genderWoman`, suggesting the effect is explained fully by risk attitudes, `r apa_print(hypothesis3c)$full_result$risk`, task score, `r apa_print(hypothesis3c)$full_result$task_score`, and confidence, `r apa_print(hypothesis3c)$full_result$conf_rank` (See Figure \@ref(fig:tab-comp-choice-study4)). On the other hand, we replicate effects from the literature of gender on both confidence, `r apa_print(exploratory18)$full_result$genderWoman`, and risk attitudes, `r apa_print(exploratory17)$full_result$genderWoman`, where women tend to be less confident with regards to their performance on the task and generally more risk averse relative to men.


```{r tab-comp-choice-study4, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "All models are logistic regressions with choice to compete as the dependent variable, where man and control are the reference categories for participant gender and preparation condition, respectively. The gender difference in the choice to compete is not reduced by preparation condition, but is explained by risk attitudes, confidence, and task scores. p < .05 is considered significant and bolded.", out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here("study4", "figs", "tab_comp-choice-study4.png"))
```


Another important consideration when interpreting any main effects found in this study is whether there are gender differences in task scores. When including gender by itself as a predictor of performance, we find that women have significantly lower task scores, `r apa_print(exploratory19)$full_result$genderWoman`. However, when controlling for competition choice, confidence, and risk attitudes, the effect of gender is not significant, `r apa_print(exploratory20)$full_result$genderWoman`, suggesting that these variables explain the gender difference in task scores. Specifically, we find that both confidence, `r apa_print(exploratory20)$full_result$conf_rank`, and competition choice, `r apa_print(exploratory20)$full_result$comp_choice`, positively predict task scores (that is, those who are more confident and chose to compete tend to have higher task scores), while risk attitudes negatively predict task scores (that is, individuals who are more risk seeking tend to have lower scores), `r apa_print(exploratory20)$full_result$risk` (See Figure \@ref(fig:tab-task-scores-study4)). See Figure \@ref(fig:summary-table-gender-study4) for a summary of gender differences in the main variables of interest.

#### Effects of unlimited preparation condition on gender differences in choice to compete 

We do not find evidence of a significant effect of preparing with multiplication or subtraction problems (task relevant vs. irrelevant preparation condition) on the choice to compete across all participants, `r apa_print(exploratory22)$full_result$conditionpract` when included as a single predictor of the choice to compete in a logistic regression. In a subsequent logistic regression adding in gender and the interaction between gender and condition as predictors, we find that gender is the only significant predictor of the choice to compete, `r apa_print(hypothesis3a)$full_result$genderWoman` and no evidence of the expected interaction effect between gender and condition on the choice to compete, `r apa_print(hypothesis3a)$full_result$genderWoman_conditionpract` (see Figure \@ref(fig:s300)).^[The interaction between gender and preparation condition on the choice to compete is still not significant among the full dataset (i.e., after including participants that were flagged by Qualtrics' fraud detection software): `r apa_print(sec_exploratory42)$full_result$genderWoman_conditionpract`]

#### Gender differences in preparation

Our next set of analyses focused on the effects of gender on decisions to practice. Thus, all subsequent analyses focus on the subset of participants that were assigned to the unlimited preparation condition that were actually given the opportunity to practice beforehand (N = `r nrow(practice)`). 

We do not replicate the effect found in both previous studies of gender on the decision to practice multiplication problems, neither in the model where gender is included by itself as a sole predictor of the choice to practice, `r apa_print(sec_exploratory39)$full_result$genderWoman` (see right panel of Figure \@ref(fig:panel-study4)), nor in tandem with the choice to compete and the interaction between gender and the choice to compete as predictors, `r apa_print(exploratory3)$full_result$genderWoman` (see left panel of Figure \@ref(fig:panel-study4)).^[The effect of gender on the choice to prepare is still not significant among the full dataset (i.e., after including participants that were flagged by Qualtrics' fraud detection software): `r apa_print(sec_exploratory43)$full_result$genderWoman`] Though the effect is not significant, the proportion of women that chose to practice was still higher than the proportion of men that chose to practice (`r ctable(practice$gender, practice$practice_problems_binary, useNA = "no")$proportions[5]*100`% of women chose to prepare via practice, relative to `r ctable(practice$gender, practice$practice_problems_binary, useNA = "no")$proportions[4]*100`% of men) among participants within the unlimited practice condition. Thus, the direction of the effects are not in contrast with previous studies. In line with the previous studies, we do not find an interaction between gender and choice to compete on the choice to practice, `r apa_print(exploratory3)$full_result$genderWoman_comp_choicetournament`. Instead we find that, like previous studies, the choice to compete is positively related to the choice to practice, `r apa_print(exploratory3)$full_result$comp_choicetournament`. In adding confidence and risk attitudes as predictors to the model with the interaction effect on top of the main effects, we do not find evidence that either of those predictors are significantly related to the choice to practice either (See Figure \@ref(fig:tab-pract-choice-study4)). Like the previous two studies in Chapter 1, we also ran a two-part hurdle model with gender, competition choice, and the interaction between those variables predicting the number of practice rounds variable (among participants in the practice condition) and again do not find evidence of gender differences in the choice to continue preparing after the initial decision to prepare, , *b* = `r summary_sec_exploratory40[["coefficients"]][["count"]][[2]]`, 95% CI [`r summary_sec_exploratory40[["coefficients"]]$count[2] - summary_sec_exploratory40[["coefficients"]]$count[6]*1.96`, `r summary_sec_exploratory40[["coefficients"]]$count[2] + summary_sec_exploratory40[["coefficients"]]$count[6]*1.96`], *z* = `r summary_sec_exploratory40[["coefficients"]]$count[10]`, *p* = `r summary_sec_exploratory40[["coefficients"]]$count[14]`.    
Unlike the previous studies, this study separated the decision to study tables and amount of time studying tables from the decision to practice and number of problems completed, so we had the novel opportunity to explore questions about gender differences in studying here. We do not find evidence that there are gender differences in the decision to study the multiplication tables, `r apa_print(exploratory2)$full_result$genderWoman`. However, among participants who did choose to study the multiplication tables (N = `r nrow(practice %>% filter(study_tables_binary == "Yes"))`; `r nrow(practice %>% filter(study_tables_binary == "Yes"))/nrow(practice)*100`% of participants in the unlimited preparation condition), we find that women studied for more time (in seconds) than men on average, M~women~ =`r printnum(mean(women$study_tables_time, na.rm = T))`, SD~women~ =`r printnum(sd(women$study_tables_time, na.rm = T))`; M~men~= `r printnum(mean(men$study_tables_time, na.rm = T))`, SD~men~ =`r printnum(sd(men$study_tables_time, na.rm = T))`, `r apa_print(exploratory1)$full_result$genderWoman`.^[However, we note that the SD for studying time among women is exceptionally high relative to that of men, so the effect may be driven by select outliers pulling the mean]

#### Perceptions of gender differences in preparation, performance, and competitiveness

Like all studies before, for each question about perceptions of gender differences, we run a chi-square goodness of fit test with the null hypothesis that participants' will choose each option at a similar rate. Since participants were given the option in this study to select one of three response options, rather than two options like the first two studies, we first perform a chi-square goodness of fit test with all response options to see if they are all equally likely. If the test with all three response options was significant, we then performed more targeted chi-square goodness of fit tests with pairs of response options within a given question to test which specific pairs of response options are significantly different. See Figure \@ref(fig:summary-table-beliefs-study4) for a summary of participants' responses to the questions about gender differences in preparation, performance, and competitiveness.

When asked to predict gender differences in preparation for the multiplication task,^[Note: this question was only asked among participants in the preparation condition] we find that participants' responding is not evenly distributed across the response options, `r apa_print(exploratory7, n = nrow(practice))$statistic`. In performing more targeted analyses, we find that participants were significantly more likely to choose “women” (`r unname(prop.table(t4)*100)[3]`%) than “men” (`r unname(prop.table(t4)*100)[1]`%), `r apa_print(exploratory33, n = nrow(practice))$statistic`, or “no difference” (`r unname(prop.table(t4)*100)[2]`%), `r apa_print(exploratory32, n = nrow(practice))$statistic` in response to this question (see Figure \@ref(fig:s303)).

This result replicates when participants are asked about gender differences in general tendencies to prepare, `r apa_print(exploratory6, n = nrow(clean_fraud_removed))$statistic` (see Figure \@ref(fig:s306)), such that, across all participants, a significantly higher proportion of participants said women prepare more in general (`r unname(prop.table(t3)*100)[3]`%) than the proportion of participants that said men prepare more (`r unname(prop.table(t3)*100)[1]`%), `r apa_print(exploratory35, n = nrow(clean_fraud_removed))$statistic`, or there are no gender differences in general tendencies to prepare (`r unname(prop.table(t3)*100)[2]`%), `r apa_print(exploratory34, n = nrow(clean_fraud_removed))$statistic`. 

Though participants consistently expected women to be more likely to prepare than men, they did not expect that there would be a gender difference in performance, `r apa_print(exploratory4, n = nrow(clean_fraud_removed))$statistic` (see Figure \@ref(fig:s304)), where participants were significantly more likely to indicate "no difference" (`r unname(prop.table(t1)*100)[2]`%) compared to "men" (`r unname(prop.table(t1)*100)[1]`%), `r apa_print(exploratory30, n = nrow(clean_fraud_removed))$statistic`, or "women" (`r unname(prop.table(t1)*100)[3]`%), `r apa_print(exploratory31, n = nrow(clean_fraud_removed))$statistic`, in response to this question. 


Despite thinking that there would be no gender difference in performance and expecting women to prepare for the task more, participants consistently expected men to be more likely to compete (`r unname(prop.table(t2)*100)[1]`%), `r apa_print(exploratory5, n = nrow(clean_fraud_removed))$statistic` (see Figure \@ref(fig:s305)), rather than expecting women to compete more (`r unname(prop.table(t2)*100)[3]`%), `r apa_print(exploratory37, n = nrow(clean_fraud_removed))$statistic`, or expecting no difference in willingness to compete across genders, (`r unname(prop.table(t2)*100)[2]`%), `r apa_print(exploratory36, n = nrow(clean_fraud_removed))$statistic`. We discuss these findings about participants' beliefs in light of the actual study results in the discussion section.

#### Effects of gender and perceptions on practicing

Like the previous two studies, we explored whether women who believed other women prepare more were especially likely to prepare. To that end, we ran the same logistic regression with the choice to practice as the dependent variable and gender, beliefs about gender differences in preparation on most tasks, and the interaction between those two variables as the predictors. Notably, the predictors representing participants' beliefs in these models had three possible values: women, men, and no difference. Like the previous studies, we focus on the interaction effect between gender and participants' selecting women as the gender that spends more time preparing while controlling for all other effects in the model. We do not replicate the interaction effect found in the previous studies, such that women who said women generally prepare more on most tasks were not significantly more likely to prepare, `r apa_print(sec_exploratory45)$full_result$genderWoman_perc_gen_gender_practWomen` (see Figure \@ref(fig:pract-choice-by-gender-and-perc-gen-prep-bar-study4)). We ran the same analysis with participants' beliefs about gender differences in preparation for the multiplication task, gender, and the interaction between the two as predictors instead, and replicate the interaction effect from the previous studies, `r apa_print(sec_exploratory44)$full_result$genderWoman_perc_task_gender_practWomen`. However, in this case, the interaction effect appears to be driven by men being especially likely to prepare when they think men spent more time preparing for the multiplication task (see Figure \@ref(fig:pract-choice-by-gender-and-perc-task-prep-bar-study4)).

#### Validating the perceived utility of preparation condition over control condition

Since we did not find any effect of the unlimited preparation condition, and this study uses a novel control task that has not been used in previous studies, we ran additional analyses to test whether participants actually felt like the preparation condition was more useful for performance on the paid multiplication task than the control condition. It is possible we did not observe an effect of condition on the choice to compete, nor an interaction effect between gender and condition, because participants simply did not think the preparation task would be more helpful for improving their performance relative to the control condition. 

To explore this null effect further, we looked into how much participants were choosing to practice across conditions, which may provide insight into why there was no difference in the choice to compete across conditions. It is possible that participants in the control condition decided to complete subtraction problems at similar rates as participants in the preparation condition decided to complete multiplication problems, and if so, this may have led them to compete at similar rates because the subtraction tables felt easier than the multiplication tables, and therefore boosted their confidence or reduced perceptions of risk. Contrary to this possibility, we find that participants in the practice condition tended to choose to study, `r apa_print(sec_exploratory48)$full_result$conditionpract`, and practice, `r apa_print(sec_exploratory47)$full_result$conditionpract`, the multiplication tables at significantly higher rates relative to participants in the control condition where they completed subtraction problems. 

In further evidence of the perceived utility of the preparation condition for improving performance on the paid multiplication task, participants across both conditions tended to believe when asked in the manipulation check that practicing multiplication problems would be more likely to improve performance on the paid multiplication task than practicing subtraction problems, `r apa_print(exploratory49, n = nrow(clean_fraud_removed))$statistic`.
