### Describing main variables of interest   

First, we explored the characteristics of the main practice variables in the dataset. Across conditions, `r freq(clean_fraud_removed$practice_problems_binary, report.nas = F)[6]`% of all participants chose to practice, with `r ctable(clean_fraud_removed$practice_problems_binary, clean_fraud_removed$condition, useNA = "no")$proportions[2]*100`% choosing to practice in the piece-rate payment condition and `r ctable(clean_fraud_removed$practice_problems_binary, clean_fraud_removed$condition, useNA = "no")$proportions[5]*100`% choosing to practice in the tournament payment condition. This difference in the choice to practice across conditions is significant when condition is included as a predictor alone, `r apa_print(sec_exploratory11)$full_result$conditiontournament`, but in the subsequent section we explain how the effect changes when including other predictors in the model. Participants spent an average of `r mean(clean_fraud_removed$total_pract_time)` seconds practicing across all rounds of practice. We replicate the effects of gender on risk attitudes, `r apa_print(sec_exploratory7)$full_result$genderWoman`, and confidence, `r apa_print(sec_exploratory8)$full_result$genderWoman` found in Chapter 1, such that women were more risk averse and less confident relative to men.  

Like all studies in Chapter 1, we find a significant effect of gender on task score when included as a sole predictor, M~women~ =`r printnum(mean(women$task_score, na.rm = T))`, SD~women~ =`r printnum(sd(women$task_score, na.rm = T))`; M~men~= `r printnum(mean(men$task_score, na.rm = T))`, SD~men~ =`r printnum(sd(men$task_score, na.rm = T))`, `r apa_print(sec_exploratory12)$full_result$genderWoman`. Contrary to the majority of studies in the first chapter, the effect of gender holds even after including risk attitudes, confidence, and an interaction between gender and condition in the model, `r apa_print(sec_exploratory4)$full_result$genderWoman` (See Figure \@ref(fig:tab-task-scores-study5)). We explore this finding further in the discussion section for this study. See Figure \@ref(fig:summary-table-gender-study5) for a summary of gender differences in the main variables of interest. 

```{r summary-table-gender-study5, fig.cap = "Gender differences in the main variables of interest, including: task scores, choice to practice, risk attitudes, and confidence.

```

### Effects of gender and competition condition on practicing

We replicate the effect of gender on the choice to practice found in Chapter 1, where `r ctable(clean_fraud_removed$gender, clean_fraud_removed$practice_problems_binary, useNA = "no")$proportions[5]*100`% of women chose to prepare via practice, relative to `r ctable(clean_fraud_removed$gender, clean_fraud_removed$practice_problems_binary, useNA = "no")$proportions[4]*100`% of men, `r apa_print(sec_exploratory25)$full_result$genderWoman` (see right panel of Figure \@ref(fig:panel-study5)). The gender effect holds in a logistic regression with gender, condition, and the interaction between the two predicting the binary choice to practice problems, `r apa_print(hypothesis1)$full_result$genderWoman` (see left panel of Figure \@ref(fig:panel-study5)). However, we do not find an interaction between gender and condition, `r apa_print(hypothesis1)$full_result$conditiontournament_genderWoman`, contrary to our hypothesis that the gender difference in the choice to prepare would be exacerbated under the tournament payment scheme relative to the piece-rate payment scheme.^[The interaction between gender and competition condition on the choice to compete is still not significant among the full dataset (i.e., after including participants that were flagged by Qualtrics' fraud detection software): `r apa_print(sec_exploratory34)$full_result$genderWoman_conditiontournament`. However, the effect of gender remains significant among the full dataset, `r apa_print(sec_exploratory34)$full_result$genderWoman_conditionpract`] Additionally, the aforementioned effect of condition on the choice to practice is no longer significant in the model including these additional predictors, `r apa_print(hypothesis1)$full_result$conditiontournament`. In a subsequent logistic regression that added confidence, risk attitudes, and task scores as predictors to explore whether they explain the gender difference in the choice to practice, we find that gender still significantly predicts the choice to practice when these variables are included in the model, `r apa_print(sec_exploratory13)$full_result$genderWoman` (See Figure \@ref(fig:tab-pract-choice-study5)). 

```{r panel-study5, fig.retina=NULL, fig.cap="Right panel shows the proportion of men and women who chose to prepare. Left panel shows the proportion of men and women who chose to prepare based on choice to compete. Women choose to prepare more than men, regardless of their decision to compete. Error bars represent standard errors.", out.width='100%', fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("study5", "figs", "panel_study5.png"))

```

```{r tab-pract-choice-study5,  fig.cap = "All models are logistic regressions with choice to prepare as the dependent variable, where man and piece-rate payment scheme are the reference categories for participant gender and competition condition, respectively. Women prepare more than men regardless of condition, task score, risk attitudes, or confidence. p < .05 is considered significant and bolded.", out.width='100%', fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("study5", "figs", "tab_pract-choice-study5.png"))
```

We also examined other measures of practice to test the robustness of the effect of gender on practicing. We find that women, relative to men, completed a significantly higher number of practice problems, `r apa_print(exploratory4a)$full_result$genderWoman`, more rounds of practice, *b* = `r obj[["coefficients"]]$count[2]`, 95% CI [`r obj[["coefficients"]]$count[2] - obj[["coefficients"]]$count[6]*1.96`, `r obj[["coefficients"]]$count[2] + obj[["coefficients"]]$count[6]*1.96`], *z* = `r obj[["coefficients"]]$count[10]`, *p* = `r obj[["coefficients"]]$count[14]`, and spent more time completing practice problems, `r apa_print(exploratory4c)$full_result$genderWoman` while controlling for payment scheme condition and the interaction between gender and payment scheme condition. None of the interaction effects were significant across any of these dependent variables, meaning that the effects of the payment scheme conditions on the preparation outcomes did not differ by gender. 

Based on previous literature on risk aversion and confidence affecting competition entry, we expected participants with especially high levels of risk aversion and/or low levels of confidence would be more likely to choose to practice before entering a competition, and that this effect may interact with gender. Thus, we tested possible three-way interactions between gender, condition, and risk aversion or confidence on the choice to practice problems through two logistic regressions, but did not find evidence that risk aversion, `r apa_print(exploratory5a)$full_result$conditiontournament_genderWoman_risk`, nor confidence, `r apa_print(exploratory5b)$full_result$conditiontournament_genderWoman_conf_rank`, interacted with gender and condition.^[Note: we run analyses with the same predictors using the other measures of preparation as dependent variables (i.e., number of practice problems completed, number of rounds of extra practice, and amount of time spent completing practice problems), and do not find evidence for interaction effects across any of those models].    

### Perceived levels of practicing based on participant gender 

Next, we ran a linear regression with gender, condition, and the interaction between those two variables predicting the aforementioned perceived practice deviation variable (that is, subtracting each participants' percentile based on number of practice problems completed from their self-rated decile) to test our second hypothesis that women would be more likely to assume they practice less than others compared to men, especially under the competitive tournament payment scheme. We find a significant effect of gender on perceived practice deviation, such that women (relative to men) were significantly less likely to assume they practice more than others, `r apa_print(hypothesis2)$full_result$genderWoman`, M~women~ =`r printnum(mean(women$perceived_pract_dev, na.rm = T))`, SD~women~ =`r printnum(sd(women$perceived_pract_dev, na.rm = T))`; M~men~ = `r printnum(mean(men$perceived_pract_dev, na.rm = T))`, SD~men~ =`r printnum(sd(men$perceived_pract_dev, na.rm = T))` (see Figure \@ref(fig:s410)). We do not observe a significant effect of condition on perceived relative practice, `r apa_print(hypothesis2)$full_result$conditiontournament`. Finally, we did not find evidence of the anticipated interaction effect between gender and condition on perceptions of relative preparation, `r apa_print(hypothesis2)$full_result$conditiontournament_genderWoman`. 


```{r s410, fig.cap="Participants' perceived practice deviation based on gender. Women had significantly lower perceived practice deviation, suggesting that they were less likely than men to overestimate their amount of practicing relative to other participants. Error bars represent standard errors.", fig.align="center", out.width="300px"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("study5", "figs", "fig02_perceived-prac-dev-by-gender.png"))

```


Since this is the first time we have used the perceived practice deviation variable and are not able to attest to its robustness, we also explored another way of testing this hypothesized effect by using participants' self-rated decile as the dependent variable instead of perceived practice deviation and then controlling for number of practice problems attempted (as a proxy for amount of practicing) in a linear regression. We find that, regardless of the number of practice problems attempted, women are significantly less likely to say they practice more than others, compared to men, `r apa_print(sec_exploratory1)$full_result$genderWoman`, which aligns with the findings from the above model using perceived practice deviation as the dependent variable.  

We also explored how self-rated decile changes based on whether participants were asked to compare their amount of practicing to men or women in the study specifically, and find that participants' perceptions of how much they practiced relative to women in the study are significantly lower than perceptions of much they practiced relative to men, `r apa_print(sec_exploratory6)$full_result`.  

### Perceptions of gender differences in preparation, performance, and competitiveness

Like in Study 3 of Chapter 1, we ran chi-square goodness of fit tests with all three response options for the questions about perceptions of gender differences, and if the test with all options was significant, we subsequently ran more targeted chi-square tests to perform pairwise comparisons. Across all measures of perceptions of gender differences in behavior, we replicate effects found in the previous studies. First, the majority of participants (`r unname(prop.table(t2)*100)[3]`%) said that women would be more likely to practice/study for the task, `r apa_print(sec_exploratory3b, n = nrow(clean_fraud_removed))$statistic` (see Figure \@ref(fig:s403)), which was significantly higher than the proportion of participants who said men would be more likely to practice/study than women (`r unname(prop.table(t2)*100)[1]`%), `r apa_print(sec_exploratory17, n = nrow(clean_fraud_removed))$statistic`, and the proportion of participants that said there was no difference in the likelihood that men and women would practice/study (`r unname(prop.table(t2)*100)[2]`%), `r apa_print(sec_exploratory16, n = nrow(clean_fraud_removed))$statistic`.

Similarly, participants were significantly more likely to say that women prepare more than men in general (`r unname(prop.table(t5)*100)[3]`% of participants), `r apa_print(sec_exploratory3e, n = nrow(clean_fraud_removed))$statistic` (see Figure \@ref(fig:s406)), relative to the proportion of participants that said men prepare more than women (`r unname(prop.table(t5)*100)[1]`% of participants), `r apa_print(sec_exploratory19, n = nrow(clean_fraud_removed))$statistic`, or that there is no difference in how much men and women prepare (`r unname(prop.table(t5)*100)[2]`% of participants), `r apa_print(sec_exploratory18, n = nrow(clean_fraud_removed))$statistic`. 

Yet, participants did not expect a gender difference in performance on the main multiplication task used, `r apa_print(sec_exploratory3a, n = nrow(clean_fraud_removed))$statistic` (see Figure \@ref(fig:s404)), where `r unname(prop.table(t1)*100)[2]`% of participants said that there was no difference in how many multiplication problems men and women correctly solved, while `r unname(prop.table(t1)*100)[1]`% said men correctly solved more multiplication problems than women, `r apa_print(sec_exploratory14, n = nrow(clean_fraud_removed))$statistic`, and `r unname(prop.table(t1)*100)[3]`% said women had a performance advantage over men, `r apa_print(sec_exploratory15, n = nrow(clean_fraud_removed))$statistic`.

Finally, `r unname(prop.table(t4)*100)[2]`% of participants expected women would be more likely to choose the piece-rate payment scheme than the tournament payment scheme, `r apa_print(sec_exploratory3d, n = nrow(clean_fraud_removed))$statistic` (see Figure \@ref(fig:s408)), which was a significantly higher proportion of participants than those who expected women would choose each payment scheme equally (`r unname(prop.table(t4)*100)[1]`%), `r apa_print(sec_exploratory22, n = nrow(clean_fraud_removed))$statistic`, and than those who expected women would choose tournament more often than piece rate, (`r unname(prop.table(t4)*100)[3]`%), `r apa_print(sec_exploratory23, n = nrow(clean_fraud_removed))$statistic`. On the contrary, when asked about how much men in the study would compete, a significant majority of participants (`r unname(prop.table(t3)*100)[3]`%) expected men to be more likely to choose the tournament payment scheme over the piece-rate payment scheme, `r apa_print(sec_exploratory3c, n = nrow(clean_fraud_removed))$statistic` (see Figure \@ref(fig:s409)), relative to the proportion of participants who said men would choose each payment scheme equally (`r unname(prop.table(t3)*100)[1]`%), `r apa_print(sec_exploratory20, n = nrow(clean_fraud_removed))$statistic`, and the proportion who said men would choose piece rate more often than tournament (`r unname(prop.table(t3)*100)[2]`%), `r apa_print(sec_exploratory21, n = nrow(clean_fraud_removed))$statistic`. See Figure \@ref(fig:summary-table-beliefs-study5) for a summary of participants' responses to the questions about gender differences in preparation, performance, and competitiveness.

#### Effects of gender and perceptions on practicing

Like all of the studies in Chapter 1, we explored whether women who believed other women prepare more were especially likely to prepare. To that end, we ran the same logistic regression with the choice to practice as the dependent variable and gender, beliefs about gender differences in preparation on most tasks, and the interaction between those two variables as the predictors. Like Study 3 of Chapter 1, the predictors representing participants' beliefs in these models had three possible values: women, men, and no difference. Like the previous studies, we focus on the interaction effect between gender and participants selecting women as the gender that spends more time preparing while controlling for all other effects in the model. We do not replicate the interaction effect found in the previous studies, such that women who said women generally prepare more on most tasks were not significantly more likely to prepare, `r apa_print(sec_exploratory36)$full_result$genderWoman_perc_gen_gender_practWomen` (see Figure \@ref(fig:pract-choice-by-gender-and-perc-gen-prep-bar-study5)). Instead, we find a main effect of gender on choice to prepare across the response options, such that women prepared more than men regardless of whether they thought women prepared more on most tasks, men prepared more, or there was no gender difference in preparation, `r apa_print(sec_exploratory36)$full_result$genderWoman`. We ran the same analysis with participants' beliefs about gender differences in preparation for the multiplication task, gender, and the interaction between the two as predictors instead, and replicate the interaction effect from the previous studies, `r apa_print(sec_exploratory35)$full_result$genderWoman_perc_task_gender_practWomen`, such that women who expected women to spend more time preparing for the multiplication task were especially likely to prepare (see Figure \@ref(fig:pract-choice-by-gender-and-perc-task-prep-bar-study5)).
