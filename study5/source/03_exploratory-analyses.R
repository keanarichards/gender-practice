# analyses -----------------------------------------------

## another way of testing hypothesis 2 - controlling for actual amount of practicing/decision to practice, do women tend to believe they practice more/less than others?

## for analysis with perceived practice deviation: why not just use their self-rated decile as the DV - & then control for actual practice number of problems practiced? interpretation would be: regardless of how much they practice, women tend to think they practice less than others
# because the problem with the perceived practice deviation is that there will be a lot of 0s, so not that much variation, whereas the self rated var by itself might have more variation
# repeat this with first two exploratory analyses (t tests)
