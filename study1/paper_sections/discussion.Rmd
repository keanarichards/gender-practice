## Summary of main experimental results 

We start with the effects of our manipulation of knowledge of the opportunity to prepare on gender differences in competitiveness. Our results suggest that knowledge of the opportunity to prepare did not change women and menâ€™s behavior to significantly different degrees. We also do not find evidence of any effect of condition on the choice to compete in general, such that participants' who knew they could prepare before choosing to compete, even if they did not necessarily know what the preparation would entail, were not significantly more likely to choose to compete than participants who were not provided this information before deciding whether to compete.  

Despite no evidence of our anticipated effects of condition and the interaction between gender and condition on the choice to compete, we still replicate the gender difference in willingness to compete when gender is included as the sole predictor of competitiveness, but later show that the effect is fully explained by differences risk attitudes, confidence, and task scores when those variables are added to the baseline model. 

Interestingly, relative to previous studies, a small proportion of men and women chose to compete. For instance, @Niederle2007 finds that 35% of women and 73% of men chose to compete, while we only find that INSERT% of women and INSERT% of men choose to compete in this study. It is possible that the online nature of the task may have contributed to this result, which we explore further in the broader discussion section summarizing results across studies. We also find that gender predicts task score, over and above other possible variables that likely drive performance (i.e., risk, choice in a payment scheme, confidence), contrary to previous research using similar arithmetic tasks [see review in @Niederle2011]. We discuss implications of this finding further in the context of the rest of the results across studies in the overall discussion section. 

## Stereotypes and gender differences in preparation

We also included several incentivized questions about participants' beliefs about gender differences across many of our behavioral variables of interest to see if participants' perceptions align with the set of results we observe, which could imply that participants observe these gender differences directly or are aware of stereotypes about gender differences. Both men and women were significantly more likely than chance to say that women prepare more than men both before completing the multiplication task used in the study and in general (unincentivized). 

Though we cannot directly attest to the general accuracy of these gender differences in preparation, since there is little research that has directly tested these gender differences, our study shows that women do indeed choose to prepare more than men, regardless of the payment scheme that they chose for their performance. Thus, we have our first piece of evidence from this study that gender differences in the choice to prepare and gender stereotypes about preparation are aligned.  

Also, both men and women were significantly more likely than chance to correctly state that men would be more likely to choose to compete during the multiplication task, suggesting strong stereotypes about gender differences in competitiveness that align with observed behavior across the literature. The finding that participants believe women compete less suggests that they did not believe women prepare more because they were more likely to compete and used preparation as a way to increase the probability that they would earn more during the competition. 

One possible explanation for participants' predictions is that they expected men to outperform women on the task, which would lead women to compensate by preparing more. Yet, they don't expect that: participants were equally likely to predict that women (vs. men) would perform better on the task, suggesting that participants did not have strong stereotypes about gender differences in performance on the multiplication task.

## Additional findings 

There may be concern that participants used a calculator to answer the multiplication questions, which could affect the interpretation of the results if there is a gender difference in calculator use and/or calculator use is related to the choice to prepare. To address that potential concern, we included questions about participants' perceptions of and actual behaviors when it came to using calculators on the paid multiplication task. Based on their responses, it is unlikely that participants used calculators in the first place. We found that participants were unlikely to use calculators to complete the task and more importantly, there were no gender differences in the choice to use a calculator. Overall, we do not have evidence that gender differences in calculator use will be a confound when interpreting our results.
