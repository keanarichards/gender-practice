# Study 1: Knowledge of preparation does NOT reduce gap in competition 

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=5, dpi=75}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("study1", "figs", "fig00_comp-choice-by-gender-and-cond-bar.png"))

```


???

Iâ€™ll start with the main question that drove this research: how do opp to prepare affect the gender differences in the choice to compete? this graph is showing our answer to that question for study 1. 

to help orient you: on the y axis here, we have the % of ppts that chose to compete, which is grouped by gender (where the purple bars represent women, & green bars represent men) and condition on the x axis (knowledge of prep cond & control cond). since the  bars between men & women are overlapping quite a bit here across conditions, we do not find evidence that the knowledge of prep condition reduces the gender gap in competitiveness.
