# Data management plan 


**Types of data:** The research data will be downloaded from the Qualtrics survey software as a .csv file, which will include the participants’ responses, along with administrative data produced by Qualtrics (e.g., date, end date, response type, progress, duration, longitude and latitude). The administrative data produced by Qualtrics will be deleted during data cleaning, leaving only the participants’ responses in the clean versions of the data available during distribution. 


**Storage:** The raw data will be stored on password-protected computers only accessible to the study personnel during data analysis. After finishing the pre-registered data analysis plan, the cleaned data (excluding administrative data produced by Qualtrics) will be stored on cloud-based storage through the public online repository Open Science Framework ([OSF](https://osf.io/)). In the clean data, participants will only be identified by unique subject ID numbers. Only key personnel will have access to the data. We do not plan on deleting the data at any point.


**Distribution:** Following emerging norms in the field, the cleaned research data (as a .csv file), code for analysis (as a .R file), and materials for the studies (as the .pdf and .qsf version of the downloaded Qualtrics survey) will be publicly available on OSF within 6 months after completion of data collection. The clean data will not include any personal identifying information and all distribution will be in accordance with the Institutional Review Board protocol.
