### Summary 
All hypotheses were [pre-registered](https://osf.io/q39a5/) unless otherwise stated and all analyses were conducted in R. We did not find evidence for the hypothesized gender difference in the choice to compete (see Figure \@ref(fig:p00)). `r ctable(clean$gender, clean$comp_choice)$proportions[4]*100`% of men chose to compete compared to `r ctable(clean$gender, clean$comp_choice)$proportions[5]*100`% of women. Women were more likely to say they would have taken the opportunity to practice the task than men (see Figure \@ref(fig:p01)), despite no gender differences in performance or choice to compete.

### Pre-registered analyses
*Primary hypothesis 1.* Using a logistic regression with gender predicting willingness to compete in round 3, we do not find significant evidence of gender differences in the choice to compete, `r apa_print(primary_hyp1)$full_result$genderWoman` (see Figure \@ref(fig:p00)).  


```{r p00, fig.cap = "Proportion of participants who chose to compete based on participant gender. Error bars represent standard error."}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("pilot", "figs", "fig00_comp-choice-by-gender-bar.png"))


```

```{r, results = "asis"}
print(ctable(clean$gender, clean$comp_choice))

```


### Exploratory analyses

Using a logistic regression, we find that gender predicts (hypothetical) willingness to practice the task, `r apa_print(exploratory1)$full_result$genderWoman` (see Figure \@ref(fig:p01)). 

```{r p01, fig.cap = "Proportion of participants who indicated they would have taken the opportunity to practice the key-entry task if provided based on participant gender. Error bars represent standard error."}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("pilot", "figs", "fig01_pract-choice-by-gender-bar.png"))

```

```{r, results = "asis"}
print(ctable(clean$gender, clean$pract_choice))

```
