### Summary 

Women were more likely to say they would have taken the opportunity to practice the task than men, despite no gender differences in performance or choice to compete.

```

### Pre-registered analyses


Primary hypothesis 1: Using a logistic regression with gender predicting willingness to compete in round 3, we do not find significant evidence of gender differences in the choice to compete, `r apa_print(primary_hyp1)$full_result$genderWoman`. 


```{r, fig.cap = "Choice to compete by gender"}


knitr::include_graphics(here::here("pilot", "figs", "fig00_comp-choice-by-gender-bar.png"))


```


### Exploratory analyses

Using a logistic regression, we find that gender predicts (hypothetical) willingness to practice the task, `r apa_print(exploratory1)$full_result$genderWoman`. 

```{r, fig.cap = "Desire to prepare by gender"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("pilot", "figs", "fig01_pract-choice-by-gender-bar.png"))

```
