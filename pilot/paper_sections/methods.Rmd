All participants  were recruited on Amazon Mechanical Turk for a study on decision-making. We excluded participants a priori if they did not meet the following inclusion criteria: failed all three comprehension check questions about the task they would be completing, were not using a computer to complete the survey (which would prohibit their performance on the task), did not identify their nationality as American or did not live in the United States (to control for gender differences in competitiveness across cultures), indicated "Other" for gender, or failed to finish the survey in its entirety. The final sample consisted of `r nrow(clean)` participants (`r freq(clean$gender, report.nas = F)[6]`% women), with an average age of `r mean(clean$age)` (*SD* = `r sd(clean$age)`) years. 

After passing the filter questions, participants completed three rounds of a one-minute matching task. To complete the task, they were first presented a legend with numbers and corresponding letters. Then, participants were presented a series of two-digit numbers and had to use the legend to enter the letters that corresponded to the numbers presented to them as quickly as possible. In rounds 1 and 2 of the task, participants were required to follow a piece-rate and tournament payment scheme, respectively. In round 3, participants had the option to choose between the two payment schemes, which served as the primary dependent variable. After completing the third round, participants completed a series of follow-up questions to be used for testing our secondary hypotheses and conducting exploratory analyses, including a decile-based measure of confidence (both relative to one's randomly assigned partner in round 2 and relative to the sample of men and women, respectively, in the study) and risk aversion. We also asked about participants' perceptions of which gender performed better. Finally, we asked about participants' perceptions of the effects of practice, if offered, on task performance improvement, along with participants' hypothetical willingness to practice the task beforehand, if given the opportunity (first as a yes/no, then if yes, in minutes willing to practice).
